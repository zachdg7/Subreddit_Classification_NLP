Here are a few things to note:

While this subbreddit says that discussing things that are less than 20 years ago(just to note, I think 20 years might be a good line for many events, I'm jsut using it for refference). But 20 years ago is 1998, and I am sure that things like The Gulf War, Bill Clinton's presidency, George H Bush's presidency, Nixon's presidency, the creation of the European Union, creation of Israel etc. while they are over 20 years ago, they still are highly politican subjects. Not to mention in 5 years the Iraq war would count as history.

Although historians are supposed to not judge the morals of people back in history if they want to stay neutral, things like slavery in America are heavily mentioned as being horrible(it was), while in the majority of history no one really cares. We judge the people that lived a few hundred years ago by different moral standards than people a few thousand years ago.

In the ancient history people were cruel, there's no denying that. But at the same time no on really pays too much attention to it since they lived very long ago(in all books/videos the only exceptions are maybe Genghis Khan(not as much)and most notably Vlad the Impaler). Which I agree to, since they had different moral standards back then.

You could argue that things like slavery still affect us today, and that countries that had slavery still exist today so it is political. So does that mean everything that the current government(as in a different nation, not as in different parties)?

I would really like to hear your thoughts, also this is my first time(if I remember correctly)posting here, so hi!

DISCLAIMER: this is a touchy subject to a lot of people, so I just want to let you know this is from a pure historical perspective, not about something like 
abolishing the Columbus day or Destroying confederate statues(I'm not even American)or anything similar to that.

He had poor eyesight and therefore was drafted in the German army as an ""Armierungs-soldat"", basically a type of unarmed manual labourer tasked with digging trenches and erecting barb wire fences along the front.

He got drafted in july 1916 and sent directly to the front in what he calls ""The Saint-Quentin area"" by the Somme. Part of the 121 Armierungs-battalion, he was quartered in a dilapidated barn in the village of Lieramont about 12-15 km from the frontlines.

Please bear in mind, this guy was half-blind so he may well be describing things wrong simply because he couldn't see for shit. Any errors are either his in misunderstanding the situation around him, or mine in translating from his handwritten diary. I've tried to preserve the somewhat archaic and confused wording in my translation. He wrote in Danish, as he'd lived for many years in Copenhagen despite being German-born.

&amp;#x200B;

The following is from july 27 1916, giving his first impression of arriving at the front during the battle of the Somme:

&amp;#x200B;

""The work took place 5 km behind the front line, could only be carried out at night. During the day the enemy could see us, and we'd be fired upon.

It took four hours to march to the worksite so we left at 6 in order to be there at 10. One never forgets the first time one arrives at the front, how horrible it was to enter that hell.

The whole landscape out to 10 km behind the line was under continous fire, the so-called curtain fire. Therefore the trip was very dangerous, both there and back again. As we approached the front, the thunder of guns got louder and louder until we entered the curtain fire iself and shells fell around us.

It is very dangerous to cross the main road, so we take a very long detour.

There's a collossal noise when a shell explodes nearby, a great coloumn of smoke and dirt rises high up in the air. People are terrified, it feels like we're on our way to the slaughterhouse.

If it gets very bad, a halt is called and one tries to seek cover or just lie flat on the ground.

It all looks like a grand fireworks, everywhere one sees flashes of light from cannon being fired. Here and there in the distance, one sees something burning.

&amp;#x200B;

The air is humming from fliers *(as close a translation as I can give; he means aircraft)*.

If one has an enemy flier above, one must stand or lay perfectly still as he sees if anyone is moving. He might throw explosives down, or he might signal to Artillery.

The filers are worst at night, then they often throw bombs down. One must also be very careful with fire, so as not to give oneself away. Smoking has caused great misfortune.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, as darkness fell, we reached our worksite. Here we were to erect barb wire fences, a very tough and dangerous job. One could not see, and one must not make the slightest noise. Only whisper. We were not far from the enemy lines, and they could easily hear us. 

In such cases, one cannot drive fenceposts into the ground for the barb wire *(hard to translate; his point is that driving posts with a sledgehamer woud make noise)* . The poles are large iron screws, that are screwed down into the ground.

On both sides, all over the line, at short intervals they launch flares *(he calls them ""lightballs"" or ""lightbullets"")*. This is so they can keep an eye on the enemy all the time, in case he should do something.

It was largely due to these flares that we could see enough to work. 

&amp;#x200B;

It otherwise went well, strangely enough there were no accidents although there was quite lively shooting.""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My ancestor went on to spend two months at the Somme during some of the worst combat, late summer of 1916, before they were relieved. He and his comrades would dig trenches or set up barb wire every night, then march out of cannon range to sleep during the day. 

&amp;#x200B;

Note, these were unarmed and untrained men set to do extremely dangerous work while under near-continous fire. Most of them had never been soldiers before, and this was less than a week after they got drafted. 

Also, the Armierungs-soldaten were the very dregs from the bottom of the barrel; my Great grandfather could barely see because of a fireworks accident, so he got lumped in with the feebleminded and the physically weak. Expendables, I guess?

&amp;#x200B;

If there is any interest, I might translate and post more exerpts from time to time. It's a lot of work though, so don't expect frequent updates.

&amp;#x200B;","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve translated an exerpt from my Great-Grandfather&amp;#39;s WWI diary. He had poor eyesight and therefore was drafted in the German army as an &amp;quot;Armierungs-soldat&amp;quot;, basically a type of unarmed manual labourer tasked with digging trenches and erecting barb wire fences along the front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He got drafted in july 1916 and sent directly to the front in what he calls &amp;quot;The Saint-Quentin area&amp;quot; by the Somme. Part of the 121 Armierungs-battalion, he was quartered in a dilapidated barn in the village of Lieramont about 12-15 km from the frontlines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please bear in mind, this guy was half-blind so he may well be describing things wrong simply because he couldn&amp;#39;t see for shit. Any errors are either his in misunderstanding the situation around him, or mine in translating from his handwritten diary. I&amp;#39;ve tried to preserve the somewhat archaic and confused wording in my translation. He wrote in Danish, as he&amp;#39;d lived for many years in Copenhagen despite being German-born.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following is from july 27 1916, giving his first impression of arriving at the front during the battle of the Somme:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The work took place 5 km behind the front line, could only be carried out at night. During the day the enemy could see us, and we&amp;#39;d be fired upon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took four hours to march to the worksite so we left at 6 in order to be there at 10. One never forgets the first time one arrives at the front, how horrible it was to enter that hell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole landscape out to 10 km behind the line was under continous fire, the so-called curtain fire. Therefore the trip was very dangerous, both there and back again. As we approached the front, the thunder of guns got louder and louder until we entered the curtain fire iself and shells fell around us.&lt;/p&gt;

Dear Redditors,

&amp;#x200B;

   I just checked r/history \--&gt; Resources --&gt; List of Recommended Books. There's nothing there about the Communist International (Comintern).  


   What's a good a book about the history of the Comintern?  


   I've been reading about Mao/ Chiang/ Sun and the founding of the Chinese Communist Party and the Kuomintang. I know there are a lot of books about those subjects. (I own many of them.) However, the Comintern was involved, deeply, in the founding of the CCP (in Moscow, I think?) and in directing it during the early days.  


   A bit later, the Comintern was also involved in founding the Korean Communist Party, in Seoul in April 1925.  


   This got me thinking: so the Comintern was staffed with Russian nationals, going around the world founding Communist Parties, and trying to foment rebellion/ revolution? What else did the Comintern do for Lenin and others?  


   I'd like to learn more about the Comintern.  


   What are your recommendations, please?

A few months ago, I remember watching about half of his video on Prussia, and leaving due to an abundance of errors in the content. Out of curiosity, a couple of days ago I visited his channel again to see how it had progressed, and to my surprise, his subscriber count has risen to 150k, and this poorly made video on Prussian history is now one of his most viewed videos. As of now this video, one which sources the always reliable infoplease.com, historyfiles.co.uk, Encyclopedia Britannica, and of course Wikipedia, has 355k views. 


This trend of relying on questionable internet sources continues until [his video on the Battle of Stalingrad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2gUIyczTsY), his first one that uses only published sources. From here on out, he is (for the most part) more ""professional"" in his research, however it seems odd to me that he would suddenly stop what has been bringing him success for so long out of the blue, and I believe this to be due to his sponsorship with Skillshare. This is the first of his videos to have a ""major"" sponsor, as other sponsors were simply IOS games and a small currency collecting website. I believe his sponsorship with Skillshare pressured him into trying to make his videos seem more professional, and thus caused him source more reliable material whilst retaining his usual method of pulling info from websites such as Wikipedia.


This is confirmed in his [recent video on the Swedish empire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTbbTMb5HVA&amp;t=437s) where he simply leaves his sources as ""WIP"". If you've ever written an academic paper, this should raise alarms, as it should never take one any considerable amount of time or effort to simply type the materials you used into a small section. 


The Armchair Historian isn't the only person throwing together poorly researched history videos with animation over it, he is just what got me to notice this trend due to the more serious nature in his videos than most history YouTube channels. As someone with more interest and knowledge in history than most people, when I see videos like those of OverSimplified and Feature History I consider them to be satirical videos more than history videos, but hadn't occurred to me until now that a vast majority of those hundreds of thousands, possibly millions of views likely saw these videos first and foremost as historical with a comedic undertone. 


With all these YouTube history channels constantly popping up, and causing more and more average people to be introduced to history, I think it necessary to remind everyone that before taking anything for granted, in these videos especially, to check your sources. 


TL;DR: The Armchair Historian is not a reliable source, and you should be more careful when trusting history Youtubers.

Also a lot of you are asking if your favourite Youtuber is completely reliable. I can say whatever I think about these people but I'm still just another guy on the internet who you have no reason to put all your faith in. If you want to know the reliability of these Youtubers, then check their sources and look into them yourselves.

Update: Also great job calling out his lack of sources in his Sweden video guys! He added two very reliable sources: [a South African website on Sweden that only sources Wikipedia](https://www.sweden.org.za/swedish-empire.html) and [a news article that mostly sources other articles from the same magazine and you guessed it...

It  would be great if you could provide a broad overview of history (or a  part of history) from the point of view of what those times were like  for people.

From what I’ve read over the past few weeks I’ve read about the evolution of Rome and the Roman Senate from Julius Caesar to Nero. When Augustus was named Consul/emperor he was very popular and he went to the Senate and “gave up his power” and carried on as if the Senate was important.

&amp;#x200B;

Before this, he writes ""He \[Homer\] does not even use the term barbarian, probably because the Hellenes had not yet been marked off from the rest of the world by one distinctive appellation."" Basically, the Greeks saw their old ancestors as very similar to barbarians.

I should make it clear that the Greeks were no ashamed or thought themselves better than their ancestors. Thucydides even writes that ""no disgrace being yet attached to such an achievement, but even some glory."" He's just saying it was a different time back then.

 

For those of you who don't know, Thucydides was an Athenian general and historian, so he would obviously have a bias towards ancient Athenians, and that really shows when he says ""the Athenians were the first to lay aside their weapons,"" meaning the Athenians were the first to secure ""habitations and their communication with each other."" He's just bragging that Athenians were the first people ever to create a civil and safe society.

This also reflects the Greek attitude towards what civilized meant. To them, it meant that citizens did not have to arm themselves with weapons because, presumably, laws and an army did the protecting for them.

Have really enjoyed listening to these. You can stream, or download the mp3 for listening offline.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0683ms3/episodes/downloads

So far they have covered:

1.    Germany
2.    USA
3.    The Netherlands
4.    Rise and Falls of Habsburgs
5.    Italy
6.    First 2 episodes of Spain

Enjoy. I found it very interesting to find out how Clausewitz compared France and Prussia.

I thought people who come to &lt;a href=""/r/history""&gt;r/history&lt;/a&gt; would like listening to these too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have really enjoyed listening to these. You can stream, or download the mp3 for listening offline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0683ms3/episodes/downloads""&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0683ms3/episodes/downloads&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far they have covered:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;   Germany&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;   USA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;   The Netherlands&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;   Rise and Falls of Habsburgs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;   Italy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;   First 2 episodes of Spain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy. I found it very interesting to find out how Clausewitz compared France and Prussia. &lt;/p&gt;

When I was probably around 8 years old, my dad (born in a village in Northern Greece) told me that there were frogs in his village that would suck milk out of a cows udder.

In this book, the narrator mentions how toads are believed to be poisonous and suck the milk out of cows.

Today we were discussing the middle passage and the slave trade, one of my friends asks the teacher: ""what do you think pirates would do if they attacked/took over a slave ship? Would they free the slaves if they took it over?"". Somewhat of an interesting question, although I'm not sure how probable it is. This branched out into a debate on whether or not slave ships were even armed, would someone be able to know a ship was a slave ship from a acceptable distance, and if it is even plausible that pirates in the 17th and 18th centuries could have encountered slave ships in the Caribbean.  

So basically the question I have is this: ""Assuming that 17/18 century pirates encountered a slave vessel that was on it's way to the new world, and decided to attack said ship for whatever reason, how would the events after that fold out?""

I would say if they DID infact attack the ship, and assuming these are your average pirates, they could easily take control of the ship. Then, once they realized that there wasn't much of value other than food, they would leave without taking any of the slaves onboard and simply go on there jolly way.

Would they free the slaves if they took it over?&amp;quot;. Somewhat of an interesting question, although I&amp;#39;m not sure how probable it is. This branched out into a debate on whether or not slave ships were even armed, would someone be able to know a ship was a slave ship from a acceptable distance, and if it is even plausible that pirates in the 17th and 18th centuries could have encountered slave ships in the Caribbean.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So basically the question I have is this: &amp;quot;Assuming that 17/18 century pirates encountered a slave vessel that was on it&amp;#39;s way to the new world, and decided to attack said ship for whatever reason, how would the events after that fold out?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would say if they DID infact attack the ship, and assuming these are your average pirates, they could easily take control of the ship. Then, once they realized that there wasn&amp;#39;t much of value other than food, they would leave without taking any of the slaves onboard and simply go on there jolly way.&lt;/p&gt;

Was cleaning out my wife’s grandfathers attic this weekend and stumbled across his old WW2 trunk. He has a US Army officer in France and was wounded and captured in the Battle of the Bulge.

The trunk included his full uniform and various other pieces of clothing, as well as hundreds of letters. I was only able to go through a handful of the letters, almost all of which were addressed to his parents. The letters pre-capture were mostly from him about army life. The letters from January 1945-March 1945 were primarily letters from members of his company describing his wounds and when they last saw him, speculating that they thought the wounds were not fatal (he was hit with shrapnel in the leg) and that they assumed he was not dead, but instead a POW. His parents didn’t find out he was alive until late March.

I say all this to say - I’d love to digitize these letters, but want to make sure that scanning them won’t damage them further. I know nothing about handling old documents, and I don’t want to destroy these little pieces of history. They are in remarkable shape considering they’ve been in an attic since 1946 (according to him, he’s still alive). Is there any special care I should take to make sure that I can digitize these?

An Alabama history text book from the early 1900&amp;#39;s. They&amp;#39;re all in great shape, too. Is this kind of stuff historically significant?

At age 12, he built a car and a motorcycle, he drove the car across the country when he was just 16 years old. Louis enrolled at Yale in 1913 and graduated in 1917, while attending, he learned to fly at a nearby Aero Club. Naturally, this inclination towards mechanics led him from automobiles and motorcycles to airplanes. He recognized early on that aviation was going to play a heavy role both in the future of travel but also during wartime. He petitioned the Governor for assistance and funding in forming a flying corps, and with the help of his family, he created the the West Virginia Flying Corps in Beech Bottom. Around the same time he started an airplane manufacturing facility, the West Virginia Aircraft company, and tried to get the Flying Corps to achieve military status, when the corps wasn't accepted, Louis decided to enlist in the British Royal Flying Corps in Toronto, Canada in October of 1917. He had accomplished all of this and was only 23 years old. 

After some training, Louis was assigned to a squadron performing home defense in England before he petitioned for reassignment on the front line. He was reassigned to northern France and began flying in an S.E.5a aircraft in July of 1918. Louis recognized the value of shooting down enemy observation balloons, the balloons were strategic in the enemy's ability to use the aerial view for directing orders and defense. In the process of 25 flights, Louis shot down 9 balloons and 3 enemy aircraft. He became a flying ace, in fact West Virginia's only flying ace of World War I. Then on August 24, 1918, just over a month after he began fighting, Louis was shooting down balloons when his airplane was hit by anti-aircraft guns defending the balloons from below. His plane went down and Louis was fatally injured, the Germans pulled him from the plane and took him to the nearby field hospital, where he succumbed to his wounds. 

Due to the fact that he was an American, the Royal Flying Corps didn't posthumously award him, nor did the Americans as he was flying for the British. Thus, his mother took it upon herself to memorialize her son. Sallie Maxwell Bennett flew overseas to Wavrin, France where he was buried under the guise of being a reporter, as the government would not let a grieving mother come into the country because it could open a floodgate. So, Sallie claimed to be a reporter and then after some searching was able to find Louis' grave and identify him by the Yale graduation ring on his finger. She exhumed his body and had it buried in the family plot in Weston. Then to properly memorialize his actions, she had Saint Martins Church reconstructed in Wavrin, France in 1919 and had a plaque placed for her son. She then donated a large tapestry in his name to St. Thomas church in New York City where she had spent much time. While visiting Westminster Abbey for an event to bestow the Medal of Honor to the British Unknown Warrior, she noted the window above the tomb. Shortly following, Sallie wrote to the Dean asking to donate a new stained glass window to memorialize her son and the Royal Flying Corps. Today, one can visit the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior in the Westminster Abbey and see both Louis Bennett Jr., as well as the West Virginia state seal providing the light onto the tomb. She had a large statue erected of Louis with aviator wings and gave it to Wheeling's military institute Linsly in 1925. The family home was donated to the county for a public library in memory of Louis Bennett Jr. as well as Louis Bennett Sr. 

Now, 100 years later, I have a son named after him and am going to visit his grave and home/library tomorrow for the first time!

\*The following is a question on world history related to the public elementary school in Pyungando in 1898 by the Ministry of Education of the Korean Empire. (Parentheses: Footnotes)\*

&amp;#x200B;

\- What is the reason why France is so astounded, and why is Emperor Napoleon I called a hero?

(Seems to say Dreyfus affair)

\- Describe based on facts rather than on what the UK is so prosperous that it has become the world 's first country and that the politics of goodness and badness compare to ours.

\- What is the reason why India is a British colony and has not been so independent?

\- How did Prussian win in the Franco-Prussian War and how did France defeat it?

\- Describe what the Austrian emperor Ferdinand I had given the throne to Franz Josef I for what reason, and what is the shape of the country now.

(A case in which Ferdinand I passed the throne to Franz Joseph I because of the revolution in 1848)

\- In the history of Italy, Ferdinando II of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies has been insulted by many countries because of his violence against the people. What about right and wrong?

(At that time, King Ferdinando II of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies bombarded the Sicilian navy in an attempt to suppress the liberation movement and said it was an internationally isolated event)

\- Describe how Russia's politics, how to treat the people of the colonies by expanding territories, and how Russia and our Korean empire will get along well.

\- Describe what country Turkey is (Ottoman Turk) and its politics right and wrong.

\- In the United States, what about edification and each formality in the world?

\- Explain clearly how our empire will become a world first class nation by politics, and how it has reached the situation because it has not changed old customs. End.

I think there is a general consensus that removing obstacles that hinder any identifiable group's access to economic benefit and social capital is a benign idea. But, recently, it has been argued that similar ideas have emerged into deadly ideologies in the past (e.g., the excesses of communism).

My questions are as follows:

1. Can we identify how ideologies such as communism became so harmful? Intellectuals in 19th Century coffee shops were not, to my knowledge, talking about mass murder. So what were the circumstances that led to the emergence of murderous leadership?
2. What role did the initial communist intelligentsia play in the transformation from seemingly benign idealism to brutal dictatorship? (I know this is far from simple, but some trends may have been noticeable).

​

I'm a Science Communicator and I'm very interested in history. Currently one of my task is to bring science hands-on activities to classrooms ranging a wide variety of subjects mostly to children between 7 and 11/12 years old.

​

Sometimes I try to connect what we are learning to certain events in history (for example, while learning how simple machines work, what uses people gave them or when they were introduced or while building paper airplanes besides explaining some of the physics and engineering involved I also show examples how mankind attempted to flight through out the ages).  What I find is a huge lack of interest in History as a subject. Not only from kids but also from the general public (Since I work at a Science Center). Although I focus manly in Scientific activities, as a ""history lover"" I find it very important to also talk about it.

What's your opinion on why is there lack of interest of the general public in history? It frustrates me seeing some teenagers or even young adults that don't know or don't care about basic stuff about the countries they live in. It's disturbing.

&amp;#x200B;

The UK was on the verge of losing air superiority over their mainland and had Goering and the Luftwaffe generals not been incompetent and continued to destroy Britain's ability to defend herself, would have been able to mount Operation Sealion and occupy the British Isles.  The land forces the UK had at their disposal for defense of the home isles after the loss of France was frighteningly small and ill equipped.    It is the failure of Luftwaffe tactics and strategy that kept Germany from achieving air superiority and invading.

&amp;#x200B;

Had the Germans been able to occupy the British Isles, they would have also probably occupied Iceland as well, which Britain didn't secure until May of 1940 (right before the BoB began).  

&amp;#x200B;

So now, if history proceeded as it did, and Germany declares war on the US after Pearl Harbor, if the US wanted to invade the continent, they would have probably had to mount an invasion of Iceland and the UK before they could then think about France.

&amp;#x200B;

But I think what a lot of people overlook is how the loss of the British Isles would have affected the Soviet Union's efforts against the Germans.   There would be no logistical support from the UK during the crucial first year of Operation Barbarossa, which despite Soviet propaganda, was probably essential in the Soviets being able to stem the tide.    The Soviets were facing a catastrophe in regards to their factories and other production being overrun in the first months of the war.   Without this immediate support, Russia would have been very hard pressed to consolidate their forces to mount the counterattacks that led to the first Soviet victories.  Also, the US would not have been able to send supplies to the Soviets later in the war, due to the Germans now owning the arctic shipping lanes.

&amp;#x200B;

Now eventually, US production capacity would produce the quantities of armor, planes, food and fuel to mount an invasion of the Continent, but maybe not before Hitler captures Moscow and the Soviet defense collapses and all the resources he needs to fuel his war machine are secured.

&amp;#x200B;

In any event, I don't think the BoB can be underestimated in terms of the strategic advantages it conveyed to the winners.

But then I read Richard Pipes' ""Russia under the Old Regime"" where he cites several instances of both Russian and English aristocrats, who saw both countries first hand, admitting that an average Russian serf is an order of magnitude better off than a ""free"" English worker.

Honestly, some of it reads like it's Michael Parenti lambasting America and praising Soviet Socialism and not Pushkin(a dissident who got repressed for demanding better treatment of the masses), and Fonvizin(Russian playwrite from the time) and a certain British Aristocrat named Robert Bremner favourably comparing Tsarist Russia to contemporary Great Britain.

(Amuzingly after providing material proof that the Russian serf is better off, the Brit goes off on a tirade about how Muh Freedom actually means the miserable English worker has a much better life)

Then I read Sergei Stepniak Kravchinsky's ""The Russian Peasantry"" where he shows amply that the abolition of serfdom actually made Russian peasants much worse off than before, which implies they could not have been that poor to begin with. (hillariously, despite spending most of the book priving incontrovertible evidence that serfrom sucked a lot less than post-emancipation Russia he keeps saying ""but actually it's better than serfdom"")

I also read David Graeber's ""Debt, the First 5000 Years"" who at one point said of Republican Rome something like this ""In all societies of the time, rulers placed restrictions on what masters could do to their slaves. In Republican Rome however, slaveowners were the state""

I also came accross a historian named Helena Schrader on Quora who claims that the Spartans were much less cruel to the Helots than Athenians were to their slaves.

Then I run accross Adam Smith saying slaves are better off where the government is despotic, because a republican government invariably has to fellate the rich - and therefore also the slaveowners - all the time in order to get re-elected.(boy, where have I seen that one before?)

""That the condition of a slave is better under an arbitrary than under a free government is, I believe, supported by the history of all ages and nations. In the Roman history, the first time we read of the magistrate interposing to protect the slave from the violence of his master is under the emperors. When Vedius Pollio, in the presence of Augustus, ordered one of his slaves, who had committed a slight fault, to be cut into pieces and thrown into his fish pond in order to feed his fishes, the emperor commanded him, with indignation, to emancipate immediately, not only that slave, but all the others that belonged to him. Under the Republic no magistrate could have had authority enough to protect the slave, much less to punish the master.""

Louis XIV's Code Noir is also noticeably less evil and dehumanizing than Antebellum USA plantation slavery:

It gave slaves the right to sundays free from work and seriously punished masters for raping and killing their slaves, namley by effectively confiscating or emancipating them in case of rape or permanent disfigurement, along with obligating masters to feed their slaves after they become infirm due to age. On top of that slaves could not be forced to marry against their will. Masters were free o manumit slaves at will and freed slaves were not to be discriminated against: ""We grant to freed slaves the same rights, privileges and immunities that are enjoyed by freeborn persons. We desire that they are deserving of this acquired freedom, and that this freedom gives them, as much for their person as for their property, the same happiness that natural liberty has on our other subjects."" (It does without saying that slavery was still hideous, what with the whipping and state-sponsored mutilation and all.)

I could go on, but I think I've made my point.

I'm leaning towards the idea that the more autocratic the government, the more humanity is shown to the lower orders, while Republics just end up being a way to ensure the govenrment never turns against the freedom of the aristocracy to rape the rest of society however it wants.

And it kind of makes sense: From an Emeror's point of view, a massive slave population is nothing but trouble: they have nothing you can tax, they can't be recruited into the army, they run away and rebel and it's you who has to quash these rebellions and bring back these runaways. And what do you get for it? Rich, slave-owning jerks who can never have enough wealth and slaves and who will do everything they can to destroy you unless you please them, at great expense to yourself.

Isn't it better to have loads of small-holding peasant farmers who are too poor to be politically active, but rich enough to pay taxes, and who don't rebel cause they at least have enough to eat, some human dignity and a family to give their life meaning? Why not take every possible opportunity to undermine slavery?

I know Machiavelli also said something similar in The Prince, when he advised rulers to crush the rich and empower the poor, because the rich are insatiable and politically activistic, while if the common people love you they will defend you, but if they don't like you they will just desert you.

Are there any historians who espouse this view? Does it have a name?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I used to think Republics, like Rome and (quasi)democracies like Athens were the places where the poor had at least somewhat of a voice, and were therefore better off. Also, with many poor people being former slaves, the poor would be inclined to help the slaves. Makes sense right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then I read Richard Pipes&amp;#39; &amp;quot;Russia under the Old Regime&amp;quot; where he cites several instances of both Russian and English aristocrats, who saw both countries first hand, admitting that an average Russian serf is an order of magnitude better off than a &amp;quot;free&amp;quot; English worker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, some of it reads like it&amp;#39;s Michael Parenti lambasting America and praising Soviet Socialism and not Pushkin(a dissident who got repressed for demanding better treatment of the masses), and Fonvizin(Russian playwrite from the time) and a certain British Aristocrat named Robert Bremner favourably comparing Tsarist Russia to contemporary Great Britain. Here&amp;#39;s a quora answer with a great quote from that book&lt;/p&gt;

So just a couple questions about the content. The story centers on Robert the Bruce, is there any one who can give a basic synopsis on his legacy? Also one question i've had since Braveheart has to do with the English noble court. As i've understood it the nobility at this time was still influenced by their Norman roots and French was the primary language spoken, i.e. Edward Longshanks spoke french rather than english; is this correct? I read that Henry Bolingbroke was the first English king who's mother's tongue was English, so does that mean that the kings before that still primarily spoke French? I understood it as by this time any anglo-saxon influence was minimal and so most of the nobles spoke french rather than english while most everyone else spoke english the whole time. Is this true? 

Once again I am by no means certain of any of this, and really am just interested in learning more and excited that Netflix decides to put the millions of dollars towards historical content. Also Chris Pine's Scottish accent seemed average to good in the trailer, but i'm not trying to nitpick because I just appreciate attention being brought to one of my favorite time periods.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So as many of you are i&amp;#39;m super excited that Netflix is putting more resources towards historical content.

Many people often give a lot of credit to the Roman Empire on how effective it was in terms of military prowess, politics (even though it was pretty shady and corrupt many times especially during the Roman Republic era), engineering, military strategy and so on. 

But this is mostly evident during the late Roman Republic era and the early-to-mid era of the Roman Empire as the there were a few instabilities in the Roman Empire that eventually made it more suspectible to entire collapse around 476CE - from less than capable leaders like Commodus, Nero and Caligula, and lots of dispute because of the massive lands that made it hard to govern by only one person until Diocletian divided the Roman Empire into 2 and later into the Tetrarchy (which also involved some internal conflict between who ruled what who was meant to be an Augustus and who was meant to be a Caesar)

The Classical Roman Empire only managed to survive for at least 400 years and at least 200 years since the Empire was divided into the East and the West, while the Eastern half of the Roman Empire managed to survive for at least a 1000 more years 

(Note - Longetivity does not necessary mean that the civilisation had lots of prowess and influence. The Byzantine Empire surely managed to prosper but until the Fourth Crusade (even reading about makles me angry that such a tragedy happened because some angry people wanted to attack someone, let alone their own allies) and when the Byzantine Empire lost almost almost all of its lands in Anatolia to the Ottamans, the Byzantine Empire was much weaker than it once was)

So ironically, while the Byzantine Empire was literally surrounded by enemies, from the Arabs and the Muslims, to the Persians, the saracens and even the Normans and the Rus (until they are became their allies and the elite bodyguards of the Emperor), it was paradoxically one of the most advanced, economically robust and thriving empire with lots of trades between Europe and Asia, massive architectural achievements like the Hogia Sophia and the Theodosian Walls and so many others (which is still very odd on how the Byzantine Empire does not get that much attention on Medieval History).

(and ironically, the Byzantine Empire still gets very little attention in general population or at least in pop culture, in comparison to the classical Roman Empire)

So how did the Byzantine Empire still manage to survive despite that it was surrounded by lots of enemies and factors that would have lost its influence entirely? What was its governing structure compared to that of the Western Roman Empire? How was it governed to keep the peace among the people of different ethnic groups and different religions?

&lt;p&gt;But this is mostly evident during the late Roman Republic era and the early-to-mid era of the Roman Empire as the there were a few instabilities in the Roman Empire that eventually made it more suspectible to entire collapse around 476CE - from less than capable leaders like Commodus, Nero and Caligula, and lots of dispute because of the massive lands that made it hard to govern by only one person until Diocletian divided the Roman Empire into 2 and later into the Tetrarchy (which also involved some internal conflict between who ruled what who was meant to be an Augustus and who was meant to be a Caesar)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Classical Roman Empire only managed to survive for at least 400 years and at least 200 years since the Empire was divided into the East and the West, while the Eastern half of the Roman Empire managed to survive for at least a 1000 more years &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Note - Longetivity does not necessary mean that the civilisation had lots of prowess and influence. The Byzantine Empire surely managed to prosper but until the Fourth Crusade (even reading about makles me angry that such a tragedy happened because some angry people wanted to attack someone, let alone their own allies) and when the Byzantine Empire lost almost almost all of its lands in Anatolia to the Ottamans, the Byzantine Empire was much weaker than it once was)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So ironically, while the Byzantine Empire was literally surrounded by enemies, from the Arabs and the Muslims, to the Persians, the saracens and even the Normans and the Rus (until they are became their allies and the elite bodyguards of the Emperor), it was paradoxically one of the most advanced, economically robust and thriving empire with lots of trades between Europe and Asia, massive architectural achievements like the Hogia Sophia and the Theodosian Walls and so many others (which is still very odd on how the Byzantine Empire does not get that much attention on Medieval History).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(and ironically, the Byzantine Empire still gets very little attention in general population or at least in pop culture, in comparison to the classical Roman Empire)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how did the Byzantine Empire still manage to survive despite that it was surrounded by lots of enemies and factors that would have lost its influence entirely? What was its governing structure compared to that of the Western Roman Empire? How was it governed to keep the peace among the people of different ethnic groups and different religions? How was the military trained &lt;/p&gt;

I went out of my way to find this piece of historic craftsmanship and I am quite pleased.

It may have been in the fifties, however based on what I see in the video I believe it was roughly made the same throughout history , of course the farther back in time, less cranks and gears and more horses.

First time posting in /history.  I was speaking to my wife last night, and she expressed a strong interest in starting to learn history.  To pique her interest I told her several interesting stories from history, such as how Genghis Kahn died, the Zaporozhian Cossack's reply to the Ottoman Empire, and Caesar being abducted by pirates and ransomed.  She had no idea history was entertaining (our foul mouthed lol).

So it got me thinking, are there any awesome anthologies with nonfiction stories that are incredibly interesting notes in time?  I think a series of shorter works would engage her better, and it would be a cool book to read anyway.

Edit:

All, thank you so much for all of the replies.  It's given me a great resource for moving forward.  I also want to thank everyone a second time, because I love history, and these books sound right up my alley.

&lt;p&gt;Or perhaps you have a favorite example based on the context and compelling story surrounding the taking of a particular strongpoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also if you have examples of an incredible impressive successful defense of a strong position that&amp;#39;s fine too. I&amp;#39;m interested in having a discussion about the attacking of fortified positions that might lead me to new historical anecdotes to explore.&lt;/p&gt;

------------------

I've spent many hours listening to history podcasts. It's easily my favourite genre of podcasting, and I think the medium has a real value in educating people on all manner of historical topics. That said, there are *a lot* of shows out there, covering all kinds of subjects, and they can vary wildly in quality. Every single one of these shows is worth a listen, but likewise, a podcast not being on the list doesn't mean it's rubbish; I had to stop the list eventually, and I haven't listened to everything!

I've spent a good few hours putting my regular recommendations into a list of shows that I *personally* think represent the very best of history podcasting. Whether its their quality of research, production value, or entertainment, these are some of the podcasts that come to mind when I see requests for shows to listen to. I think I got a good mix of famous classics and relative unknowns! 

See the list with appropriate images and links, click [HERE](https://www.podchaser.com/lists/High-Quality-History-Podcasts-2533). Otherwise, in no particular order:


**Topical - Focused on one particular theme or global event**

* **Revolutions** ([Website](http://www.revolutionspodcast.com/) | [Apple](https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/id703889772?mt=2&amp;ls=1) | [RSS Feed](http://revolutionspodcast.libsyn.com/rss))

&gt; When Mike Duncan finished off the History of Rome, this was the project that he focused his knowledge and experience of podcasting on. This show looks at different revolutions and rebellions, how they came about, and what happened to the participants. The English Civil War, American Revolution, French Revolution, Haitian Revolution, and now the various revolutions of the 19th century are all covered in this show. Man the barricades!

* **Tides of History**  ([Website](http://wondery.com/shows/tides-of-history/) | [Apple](https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/id1257202425?mt=2&amp;ls=1) | [RSS Feed](https://rss.art19.com/tides-of-history))

&gt; A highly qualified and entertaining presenter, Dr Patrick Wyman hosts this thematic show. Incredibly well produced and highly informative, you know you're getting accurate info from him. Dr Wyman creates composite characters, individuals that didn't actually exist, but who are based on a range of people that did, to put his listeners into their shoes. It really helps contextualise events and societies that are completely alien to us; what the daily life of a Venetian merchant was like, or how European society kept going after the ravages of the Black Death etc. Backed up by the latest in scholarship, Tides of History is certainly worth a listen.

* **When Diplomacy Fails** ([Website](http://www.wdfpodcast.com/) | [Apple](https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/id528826104?mt=2&amp;ls=1) | [RSS Feed](http://rss.acast.com/whendiplomacyfails))

&gt; As you might expect from the name, Zack Twamley's podcast is all about war, and particularly why wars happen, and it's great. He does an amazing job of looking at the build up to wars, key battles, and important personalities. His, frankly ridiculous, work ethic means that you will probably never run out of content, which is always positive when you find a show as good as this!

* **Second Decade** ([Website](https://seconddecade.net/) | [Apple](https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/id1170961607?mt=2&amp;ls=1) | [RSS Feed](http://feeds.megaphone.fm/ADL6191850545))

&gt; Dr Sean Munger has chosen a single decade, the 1810s, for the topic of his show. This might seem like a very short time frame to dedicate a podcast to, but not at all. After all, this is the time of Napoleon, Bolivar, Frankenstein, and Madison, and one of those is not like the other.

* **Stuff What You Tell Me** ([Website](https://stuffwhatyoutellme.com/) | [Apple](https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/id1192013429?mt=2&amp;ls=1) | [RSS Feed](https://feeds.megaphone.fm/stuff-what-you-tell-me))

&gt; A show all about the injustices of history, and the attempts by ordinary people to fight them. There are few podcasts that I've listened to that have made me angry, but this is one of them. Not at the show itself, of course, but at what people have suffered, and how often it keeps happening.

&gt; This is all tempered by the thoroughly enjoyable presentation. Imagine a more erudite, reasonable, and less-shouty Jim Jefferies, and you have the right idea.

* **80 Days: An Exploration Podcast** ([Website](https://80dayspodcast.com/) | [Apple](https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/id1139128775?mt=2&amp;ls=1) | [RSS Feed](http://80dayspodcast.com/category/podcast-episodes/feed/))

&gt; Three Irish history and geography nerds in an internet-powered balloon talk about unusual, unknown, and unique places in the world. If you read their episode list and haven't heard of the locations they cover, give it a download and listen. Every episode is devoted to a small, out of the way, unknown or just unique part of the world; it could be the Walled City of Howloon, the Jewish Autonomous Oblast in eastern Siberia, Liechtenstein or the Isle of Man. 

* **History of the Great War** ([Website](http://www.historyofthegreatwar.com/) | [Apple](https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/id894243371?mt=2&amp;ls=1) | [RSS Feed](https://feeds.megaphone.fm/ADL8806925450))

&gt; We are just a few months away from the centenary of the Armistice. Now is the time to learn more about such a critical war, a conflict that is often overshadowed by its more destructive younger brother. This show is definitely worth your time, and if it strikes you fancy there are over a hundred and fifty episodes to binge through!

* **The History of WWII Podcast** ([Website](https://worldwariipodcast.net/) | [Apple](https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/id493253759?mt=2&amp;ls=1) | [RSS Feed](http://feeds.megaphone.fm/history-of-world-war-ii))

&gt; I don't think any podcaster in this list has a topic as famous as Ray Harris has, and he does it great justice. If you have any interest in the Second World War, and who doesn't, give this a try. With over 200 episodes to choose from, you may very well be spoilt for choice.

* **Why Is That Podcast** ([Website](http://whyisthatpodcast.blogspot.com/) | [Apple](https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/id1354456347?mt=2&amp;ls=1) | [RSS Feed](https://rss.acast.com/whyisthatpodcast))

&gt; Your one-stop-shop for random chunks of knowledge. Travis answers questions you didn't even realise you had; do you give a damn about the origins of 'I don't give a damn!'? Why do different countries drive on different sides of the road? What makes flags so ubiquitous, and why is the middle finger the black sheep of the hand family?

* **The History of Witchcraft** ([Website](https://cms.megaphone.fm/channel/ADL7709657083/)  | [Apple](https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/id1239548646?mt=2&amp;ls=1) | [RSS Feed](https://feeds.megaphone.fm/ADL7709657083))

&gt; Full disclosure: This is my own show, but I apply the same standards to myself as I do the others in this list. Over thirty episodes, I’ve covered topics as varied as the destruction of the Knights Templar, how Zoroastrian Persia warded off baby-eating demons, what the Romans used carved stone penises for, and why Pythagoras should be associated with much more than triangles. The bulk of the podcast has been on the European witch hunts of the 16th and 17th centuries, and trying to explain the context in which they happened. I've just finished looking at the career of the Witch-Finder General, Matthew Hopkins, as he took part in the single deadliest witch panic in English history.

* **The Dangerous History Podcast** ([Website](http://profcj.org/)  | [Apple](https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/id893725777?mt=2&amp;ls=1) | [RSS Feed](http://feeds.megaphone.fm/ADL8114804847))

&gt; With a voice and style that is incredibly enjoyable to listen to, CJ will take you through some of the most controversial and fascinating subjects in all of history. Willing and eager to go against the grain when needed, Dangerous History is well worth a listen.

* **Dead Ideas** ([Website](https://deadideas.net/)  | [Apple](https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/id1148407560?mt=2&amp;ls=1) | [RSS Feed](http://feeds.megaphone.fm/dead-ideas))

&gt; The past is a foreign country, and this show epitomises that. Everything from serfdom to self-mummification, witchcraft to Josep Tito, Dead Ideas handles the bizarre, unusual, and fascinating. Hosted by B. T. Newburg and supported by a range of co-hosts, listen to this if you're interested in all the weird and wonderful things that humans have been up to.

* **Human Circus: Journeys through the Medieval World** ([Website](http://recordedhistory.net/human-circus/)  | [Apple](https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/id1194921513?mt=2&amp;ls=1) | [RSS Feed](https://feeds.megaphone.fm/human-circus?format=rss))

&gt; Devon Field's show is all about creating tales of subjects that are often forgotten in today's world. He has a talent at making the listener feel like they know the individuals in each of his stories, with details and perspectives that help bring the people he talks about alive, while also setting them firmly in their surroundings and societies.

* **History on Fire** ([Website](http://historyonfirepodcast.com/episodes/)  | [Apple](https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/id1038514498?mt=2&amp;ls=1) | [RSS Feed](http://feeds.podtrac.com/xUnmFXZLuavF))

&gt; Two things tend to said when History on Fire is brought up. The first is that Bolelli is Italian, which is quite a rare accent in history podcasting, and notable because of it. The second thing is that History on Fire is INCREDIBLE. The depth and detail Professor Bolelli brings to the table is a good thing on its own, but the entertainment value he brings is on another level.

* **Dan Carlin's Hardcore History** ([Website](http://www.dancarlin.com/)  | [Apple](https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/id173001861?mt=2&amp;ls=1) | [RSS Feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/dancarlin/history?format=xml))

&gt; If someone has only ever listened to one history podcast in their entire life, chances are good that it was this. What can I say about this podcast that hasn't been said a thousand times before? Dan Carlin may not keep to the same level of detail and accuracy as most of the other podcasters in this list, but he makes up for it tenfold in entertainment. Also, if I didn't include him in this list, I'd get yelled at!

**European History**

* **The History of Rome** ([Website](http://thehistoryofrome.typepad.com/the_history_of_rome/)  | [Apple](https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/id261654474?mt=2&amp;ls=1) | [RSS Feed](http://historyofrome.libsyn.com/rss))

&gt; THE classic history podcast by Mike Duncan. If your hypothetical one-podcast listener hadn't heard of Hardcore History, they'll have heard of the History of Rome. From the legendary foundation of the Eternal City, to the last western Emperor, this is a monumental undertaking, and every second is worth it.

* **The History of England** ([Website](http://www.thehistoryofengland.com/)  | [Apple](https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/id412308812?mt=2&amp;ls=1) | [RSS Feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/TheHistoryofEngland)

&gt; Brilliant, funny, entertaining look at every aspect of English history. David Crowther is a self-described 'man-in-a-shed', a stereotypical 'dad' with all the awful jokes, cliché accents, and personal injections you'd expect. As of writing, Henry VIII has just died, and we are entering the era of Regency, Bloody Mary, and Gloriana!

* **The Things that Made England** ([Website](https://www.facebook.com/groups/609342826077337/)  | [Apple](https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/id1371367028?mt=2&amp;ls=1) | [RSS Feed](https://rss.acast.com/thingsthatmadeengland))

&gt; A series of discussions between the creator of the History of England, and the creator of 10 American Presidents, two proud Englishmen who hate the way English patriotism has been co-opted by ugly racism and xenophobia. Each episode one of them brings up an institution or event that they believe 'made England'; some you might expect, like 1066 and Dunkirk, but others might take you by surprise, such as the discussions on Ska and Brown Sauce. Together they decide where it can go on display in 'The Cabinet' as one of the things that made England. Very relaxed, often quite thought-provoking, and highly entertaining.

* **The British History Podcast** ([Website](https://www.thebritishhistorypodcast.com/)  | [Apple](https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/id440985304?mt=2&amp;ls=1) | [RSS Feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/TheBritishHistoryPodcast))

&gt; I don't think there's a show on this list that goes into greater depth than BHP. After 300 regular episodes, not counting all the bonus and premium episodes, Jamie is on Æthelstan, first King of the English. Astonishingly good podcast, and well worth your time.

* **The Age of Victoria** ([Website](http://www.ageofvictoriapodcast.com/)  | [Apple](https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/id1234105258?mt=2&amp;ls=1) | [RSS Feed](http://www.ageofvictoriapodcast.com/feed/podcast/))

&gt; Chris' passionate interest in the Victorians shines through in this monthly show. So far, he has examined the foundation of the Victorian era in the ashes of the Napoleonic Wars, as Britain finally triumphs over its continental rival, ushering in the Pax Britannica.

* **The Age of Napoleon** ([Website](http://recordedhistory.net/the-age-of-napoleon//)  | [Apple](https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/id1223795973?mt=2&amp;ls=1) | [RSS Feed](https://feeds.megaphone.fm/ADL5280986787))

&gt; This may come as a shock, but the topic of this podcast involves Napoleon Bonaparte. However, it also involves a highly engaging narrative of the context of 18th and 19th century Europe, how and why the French Revolution broke out, and the rise to power of the man himself. An incredible look at an incredible topic.

* **The History of Byzantium** ([Website](http://www.acast.com/thehistoryofbyzantium)  | [Apple](https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/id527579475?mt=2&amp;ls=1) | [RSS Feed](https://rss.acast.com/thehistoryofbyzantium))

&gt; A spiritual successor to the History of Rome. Robin Peirson's History of Byzantium continues from there, breathing incredible life into the medieval Roman Empire that is often overlooked. Hear about the reigns of emperors you've heard of, like Justinian and Nikephoros Phokas, and those you might not have, like Heraclius or Michael the Amorian. The political scheming may be appropriately Byzantine (heh) but Robin steers you through it like an expert.

* **The Bulgarian History Podcast** ([Website](http://bghistorypodcast.com/)  | [Apple](https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/id733259236?mt=2&amp;ls=1) | [RSS Feed](http://feeds.soundcloud.com/users/soundcloud:users:173948481/sounds.rss))

&gt; The history of Bulgaria is often criminally overlooked. If you don't believe me, give this show a listen. Think of this like the more relaxed cousin to the History of Byzantium, due to how often their stories coincide. 

* **The Fall of Rome** ([Website](https://fallofromepodcast.wordpress.com/)  | [Apple](https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/id1141563910?mt=2&amp;ls=1) | [RSS Feed](https://rss.art19.com/the-fall-of-rome-podcast))

&gt; Dr Patrick Wyman's earlier work, and just as premium quality as Tides. Rome is his specialty, you can tell that this is a topic that he is passionate and incredibly knowledgeable about.

* **The History of Ancient Greece** ([Website](http://www.thehistoryofancientgreece.com/)  | [Apple](https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/id1100563458?mt=2&amp;ls=1) | [RSS Feed](http://ancientgreece.libsyn.com/rss))

&gt; Ryan Stitt's show covers every possible aspect of the Greek civilisation, from the set piece battles that have echoed down the millennia, to the philosophers and playwrights whose works have played an immeasurable role in the development of 'Western Civilisation'. Also, there's the Bacchanalia. Don't know what that is? Don't just google it, give this show a listen and find out.

* **The History of Germany Podcast** ([Website](http://podcastnik.com//)  | [Apple](https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/id907826048?mt=2&amp;ls=1) | [RSS Feed](http://rss.acast.com/historyofgermany))

&gt; From the barbarian tribes that plagued Rome to the Kaiser of the German Empire, Travis Dow is covering the history of the Germanic peoples who have played a central role in not just European, but global, history. As an added bonus, you can listen to it in a choice of English, Germany, or Arabic!

* **The History of Vikings** ([Website](http://thehistoryofvikings.com///)  | [Apple](https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/id1363609926?mt=2&amp;ls=1) | [RSS Feed](http://thehistoryofvikings.com/feed/podcast/))

&gt; Vikings are fun. This is an incontrovertible fact. I say this with a millennium or more to keep them away from me, since they're still the baddies. I certainly wouldn't want to be resident along any stretch of European water for roughly three centuries. Still, they're fun to learn about, and Noah backs up his own knowledge and expertise with guest appearances from a variety of experts, from re-enactors to leading academics.

* **The History of Poland** ([Website](https://historyofpolandpodcast.com/)  | [Apple](https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/id1223834245?mt=2&amp;ls=1) | [RSS Feed](http://historyofpoland.libsyn.com/rss))

&gt; It seems to me that Poland is one of those countries that tends to get overlooked, except when it falls victim to one of its neighbours. Trevor does an amazing job at fixing that. Currently in the medieval era, Trevor has shown Poland unite, fall apart, reunite, adopt Christianity, reject Christianity, play kingmaker in Russia and play the diplomatic game with the Holy Roman Empire and Hungary. It is a genuine treat to see a new episode appear in my feed, and it will be the same for you.

* **Pontifacts** ([Website](https://pontifacts.podbean.com/)  | [Apple](https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/id1387540364?mt=2&amp;ls=1) | [RSS Feed](https://pontifacts.podbean.com/feed/))

&gt; Possibly the youngest podcast in this list, Pontifacts has come rushing out of the gate.  Bry and Fry are devoting an episode to each Pope, and most anti-popes; this means that some of the episodes will be incredibly short (how much can you really talk about Urban VII's 13 day reign?) and others will be incredibly long (John Paul II for example, but that will be a while away in show-time). One of the few collaborative shows to make this list, and well deserved.

**American History**

* **Early and Often: The History of Elections in America** ([Website](http://earlyandoften.libsyn.com/website/)  | [Apple](https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/id1274290333?mt=2&amp;ls=1) | [RSS Feed](http://earlyandoften.libsyn.com/rss/))

&gt; A podcast that uses the political institutions of the American Colonies as a framework for a history of the continent. How did the English settlements react to the turbulent religious and political upheavals back home? Did they really have to listen to a parliament that was half a world away? 

* **American Revolution Podcast** ([Website](https://amrev.podbean.com/)  | [Apple](https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/id1270200540?mt=2&amp;ls=1) | [RSS Feed](https://amrev.podbean.com/feed.xml))

&gt; A narrative of the events leading up to and during the Great Rebellion of Ungrateful Colonials.... I mean, the American War of Independence. Sorry, that just slipped out.

&gt; Michael Troy takes an incredibly detailed and insightful look at the context of the war, the growing discontent with the political situation, and how the conflict was actually fought. 

* **The Age of Jackson Podcast** ([Website](http://www.spreaker.com/show/the-age-of-jackson-podcast/)  | [Apple](https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/id1337546138?mt=2&amp;ls=1) | [RSS Feed](http://www.spreaker.com/show/2815035/episodes/feed))

&gt; Hosted by a Stanford PhD student, Daniel speaks to some of the leading scholars on Antebellum America, the crème de la crème of academia, and so presents his listeners with high quality information. That's important for a subject as controversial as Jacksonian America, with topics like slavery, relations with Indians, piracy, and banking.

&gt; I have enjoyed every interview I've listened to, and come away knowing a lot more than I did about this era.

* **Portraits of Blue &amp; Grey: The Biographical Civil War Podcast** ([Website](http://recordedhistory.net/portraits-of-blue-and-grey/)  | [Apple](https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/id1236292774?mt=2&amp;ls=1) | [RSS Feed](https://feeds.megaphone.fm/ADL1680784575))

&gt; Telling the story of the US Civil War through the lens of the individuals involved, ranging from the generals and politicians you might have heard of, and the less famous but just as fascinating people among the millions the conflict effected, Christopher Moore does a fantastic job of teaching the subject. As someone who didn't know much about it, as a non-American, Portraits has greatly helped fix my lackluster knowledge!

**You may like to think of these last four podcasts as linked. Listen to all four, and you'll get a pretty good grasp of the makings of the modern United States**

* **10 American Presidents** ([Website](http://www.acast.com/10americanpresidents/)  | [Apple](https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/id958858173?mt=2&amp;ls=1) | [RSS Feed](http://rss.acast.com/10americanpresidents))

&gt; Created by Roifield Brown, this show brings on a variety of quality podcasters to talk about... American Presidents. Dan Carlin talked about Nixon, Mike Duncan about George Washington etc. They're engrossing to listen to, and each host brings their own style to the episodes.

**Asian History**

&gt; Chris Stewart does an amazing job at making a several thousand year old civilisation consumable for ordinary people. I wouldn't have a chance of either remember or pronouncing the various Chinese names, dynasties, and regions without him. Absolutely incredible history with so much brutal slaughter and machiavellian politics it's like if A Song of Ice and Fire had a baby with Warhammer 40k, and the baby had the Mandate of Heaven to do whatever it wanted, including wipe out entire family trees based on a whiff of treason, or sacrifice thousands of lives to build a monument to their own divinity, before drinking mercury to try and reach immortality.

&gt; A topical podcast, rather than a narrative history, Laszlo's China History Podcast covers subjects as varied as they are informative. How did the Middle Kingdom develop its martial arts? What happened when Nixon visited the PRC? Why is tea so important? Seriously. There is a ten-part series on tea. It's a big deal.

&gt; A former-PhD student at the University of Washington, Isaac Meyer proves his credentials not only by having one of the best logos in all of podcasting, but also because his doctorate was on... the History of Japan! With almost 250 episodes so far, set aside some time for this incredibly thorough and fascinating show.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;X-Post from &lt;a href=""/r/podcasts""&gt;/r/podcasts&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve spent many hours listening to history podcasts. It&amp;#39;s easily my favourite genre of podcasting, and I think the medium has a real value in educating people on all manner of historical topics. That said, there are &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of shows out there, covering all kinds of subjects, and they can vary wildly in quality. Every single one of these shows is worth a listen, but likewise, a podcast not being on the list doesn&amp;#39;t mean it&amp;#39;s rubbish; I had to stop the list eventually, and I haven&amp;#39;t listened to everything!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve spent a good few hours putting my regular recommendations into a list of shows that I &lt;em&gt;personally&lt;/em&gt; think represent the very best of history podcasting. Whether its their quality of research, production value, or entertainment, these are some of the podcasts that come to mind when I see requests for shows to listen to. I think I got a good mix of famous classics and relative unknowns! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See the list with appropriate images and links, click &lt;a href=""https://www.podchaser.com/lists/High-Quality-History-Podcasts-2533""&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;. Otherwise, in no particular order:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Topical - Focused on one particular theme or global event&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Revolutions&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=""http://www.revolutionspodcast.com/""&gt;Website&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/id703889772?mt=2&amp;amp;ls=1""&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=""http://revolutionspodcast.libsyn.com/rss""&gt;RSS Feed&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Mike Duncan finished off the History of Rome, this was the project that he focused his knowledge and experience of podcasting on. This show looks at different revolutions and rebellions, how they came about, and what happened to the participants. The English Civil War, American Revolution, French Revolution, Haitian Revolution, and now the various revolutions of the 19th century are all covered in this show. Man the barricades!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tides of History&lt;/strong&gt;  (&lt;a href=""http://wondery.com/shows/tides-of-history/""&gt;Website&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/id1257202425?mt=2&amp;amp;ls=1""&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=""https://rss.art19.com/tides-of-history""&gt;RSS Feed&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A highly qualified and entertaining presenter, Dr Patrick Wyman hosts this thematic show. Incredibly well produced and highly informative, you know you&amp;#39;re getting accurate info from him. Dr Wyman creates composite characters, individuals that didn&amp;#39;t actually exist, but who are based on a range of people that did, to put his listeners into their shoes. It really helps contextualise events and societies that are completely alien to us; what the daily life of a Venetian merchant was like, or how European society kept going after the ravages of the Black Death etc. Backed up by the latest in scholarship, Tides of History is certainly worth a listen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you might expect from the name, Zack Twamley&amp;#39;s podcast is all about war, and particularly why wars happen, and it&amp;#39;s great. He does an amazing job of looking at the build up to wars, key battles, and important personalities. His, frankly ridiculous, work ethic means that you will probably never run out of content, which is always positive when you find a show as good as this!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Sean Munger has chosen a single decade, the 1810s, for the topic of his show. This might seem like a very short time frame to dedicate a podcast to, but not at all. After all, this is the time of Napoleon, Bolivar, Frankenstein, and Madison, and one of those is not like the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A show all about the injustices of history, and the attempts by ordinary people to fight them. There are few podcasts that I&amp;#39;ve listened to that have made me angry, but this is one of them. Not at the show itself, of course, but at what people have suffered, and how often it keeps happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is all tempered by the thoroughly enjoyable presentation. Imagine a more erudite, reasonable, and less-shouty Jim Jefferies, and you have the right idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three Irish history and geography nerds in an internet-powered balloon talk about unusual, unknown, and unique places in the world. If you read their episode list and haven&amp;#39;t heard of the locations they cover, give it a download and listen. Every episode is devoted to a small, out of the way, unknown or just unique part of the world; it could be the Walled City of Howloon, the Jewish Autonomous Oblast in eastern Siberia, Liechtenstein or the Isle of Man. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are just a few months away from the centenary of the Armistice. Now is the time to learn more about such a critical war, a conflict that is often overshadowed by its more destructive younger brother. This show is definitely worth your time, and if it strikes you fancy there are over a hundred and fifty episodes to binge through!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The History of WWII Podcast&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=""https://worldwariipodcast.net/""&gt;Website&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/id493253759?mt=2&amp;amp;ls=1""&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=""http://feeds.megaphone.fm/history-of-world-war-ii""&gt;RSS Feed&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think any podcaster in this list has a topic as famous as Ray Harris has, and he does it great justice. If you have any interest in the Second World War, and who doesn&amp;#39;t, give this a try. With over 200 episodes to choose from, you may very well be spoilt for choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your one-stop-shop for random chunks of knowledge. Travis answers questions you didn&amp;#39;t even realise you had; do you give a damn about the origins of &amp;#39;I don&amp;#39;t give a damn!&amp;#39;? Why do different countries drive on different sides of the road? What makes flags so ubiquitous, and why is the middle finger the black sheep of the hand family?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The History of Witchcraft&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=""https://cms.megaphone.fm/channel/ADL7709657083/""&gt;Website&lt;/a&gt;  | &lt;a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/id1239548646?mt=2&amp;amp;ls=1""&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=""https://feeds.megaphone.fm/ADL7709657083""&gt;RSS Feed&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full disclosure: This is my own show, but I apply the same standards to myself as I do the others in this list. Over thirty episodes, I’ve covered topics as varied as the destruction of the Knights Templar, how Zoroastrian Persia warded off baby-eating demons, what the Romans used carved stone penises for, and why Pythagoras should be associated with much more than triangles. The bulk of the podcast has been on the European witch hunts of the 16th and 17th centuries, and trying to explain the context in which they happened. I&amp;#39;ve just finished looking at the career of the Witch-Finder General, Matthew Hopkins, as he took part in the single deadliest witch panic in English history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Dangerous History Podcast&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=""http://profcj.org/""&gt;Website&lt;/a&gt;  | &lt;a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/id893725777?mt=2&amp;amp;ls=1""&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=""http://feeds.megaphone.fm/ADL8114804847""&gt;RSS Feed&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a voice and style that is incredibly enjoyable to listen to, CJ will take you through some of the most controversial and fascinating subjects in all of history. Willing and eager to go against the grain when needed, Dangerous History is well worth a listen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dead Ideas&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=""https://deadideas.net/""&gt;Website&lt;/a&gt;  | &lt;a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/id1148407560?mt=2&amp;amp;ls=1""&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=""http://feeds.megaphone.fm/dead-ideas""&gt;RSS Feed&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The past is a foreign country, and this show epitomises that. Everything from serfdom to self-mummification, witchcraft to Josep Tito, Dead Ideas handles the bizarre, unusual, and fascinating. Hosted by B. T. Newburg and supported by a range of co-hosts, listen to this if you&amp;#39;re interested in all the weird and wonderful things that humans have been up to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Devon Field&amp;#39;s show is all about creating tales of subjects that are often forgotten in today&amp;#39;s world. He has a talent at making the listener feel like they know the individuals in each of his stories, with details and perspectives that help bring the people he talks about alive, while also setting them firmly in their surroundings and societies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;History on Fire&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=""http://historyonfirepodcast.com/episodes/""&gt;Website&lt;/a&gt;  | &lt;a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/id1038514498?mt=2&amp;amp;ls=1""&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=""http://feeds.podtrac.com/xUnmFXZLuavF""&gt;RSS Feed&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two things tend to said when History on Fire is brought up. The first is that Bolelli is Italian, which is quite a rare accent in history podcasting, and notable because of it. The second thing is that History on Fire is INCREDIBLE. The depth and detail Professor Bolelli brings to the table is a good thing on its own, but the entertainment value he brings is on another level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dan Carlin&amp;#39;s Hardcore History&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=""http://www.dancarlin.com/""&gt;Website&lt;/a&gt;  | &lt;a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/id173001861?mt=2&amp;amp;ls=1""&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=""http://feeds.feedburner.com/dancarlin/history?format=xml""&gt;RSS Feed&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If someone has only ever listened to one history podcast in their entire life, chances are good that it was this. What can I say about this podcast that hasn&amp;#39;t been said a thousand times before? Dan Carlin may not keep to the same level of detail and accuracy as most of the other podcasters in this list, but he makes up for it tenfold in entertainment. Also, if I didn&amp;#39;t include him in this list, I&amp;#39;d get yelled at!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;European History&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE classic history podcast by Mike Duncan. If your hypothetical one-podcast listener hadn&amp;#39;t heard of Hardcore History, they&amp;#39;ll have heard of the History of Rome. From the legendary foundation of the Eternal City, to the last western Emperor, this is a monumental undertaking, and every second is worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The History of England&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=""http://www.thehistoryofengland.com/""&gt;Website&lt;/a&gt;  | &lt;a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/id412308812?mt=2&amp;amp;ls=1""&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=""http://feeds.feedburner.com/TheHistoryofEngland""&gt;RSS Feed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brilliant, funny, entertaining look at every aspect of English history. David Crowther is a self-described &amp;#39;man-in-a-shed&amp;#39;, a stereotypical &amp;#39;dad&amp;#39; with all the awful jokes, cliché accents, and personal injections you&amp;#39;d expect. As of writing, Henry VIII has just died, and we are entering the era of Regency, Bloody Mary, and Gloriana!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of discussions between the creator of the History of England, and the creator of 10 American Presidents, two proud Englishmen who hate the way English patriotism has been co-opted by ugly racism and xenophobia. Each episode one of them brings up an institution or event that they believe &amp;#39;made England&amp;#39;; some you might expect, like 1066 and Dunkirk, but others might take you by surprise, such as the discussions on Ska and Brown Sauce. Together they decide where it can go on display in &amp;#39;The Cabinet&amp;#39; as one of the things that made England. Very relaxed, often quite thought-provoking, and highly entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The British History Podcast&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=""https://www.thebritishhistorypodcast.com/""&gt;Website&lt;/a&gt;  | &lt;a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/id440985304?mt=2&amp;amp;ls=1""&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=""http://feeds.feedburner.com/TheBritishHistoryPodcast""&gt;RSS Feed&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think there&amp;#39;s a show on this list that goes into greater depth than BHP. After 300 regular episodes, not counting all the bonus and premium episodes, Jamie is on Æthelstan, first King of the English. Astonishingly good podcast, and well worth your time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris&amp;#39; passionate interest in the Victorians shines through in this monthly show. So far, he has examined the foundation of the Victorian era in the ashes of the Napoleonic Wars, as Britain finally triumphs over its continental rival, ushering in the Pax Britannica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Age of Napoleon&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=""http://recordedhistory.net/the-age-of-napoleon//""&gt;Website&lt;/a&gt;  | &lt;a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/id1223795973?mt=2&amp;amp;ls=1""&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=""https://feeds.megaphone.fm/ADL5280986787""&gt;RSS Feed&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may come as a shock, but the topic of this podcast involves Napoleon Bonaparte. However, it also involves a highly engaging narrative of the context of 18th and 19th century Europe, how and why the French Revolution broke out, and the rise to power of the man himself. An incredible look at an incredible topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The History of Byzantium&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=""http://www.acast.com/thehistoryofbyzantium""&gt;Website&lt;/a&gt;  | &lt;a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/id527579475?mt=2&amp;amp;ls=1""&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=""https://rss.acast.com/thehistoryofbyzantium""&gt;RSS Feed&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spiritual successor to the History of Rome. Robin Peirson&amp;#39;s History of Byzantium continues from there, breathing incredible life into the medieval Roman Empire that is often overlooked. Hear about the reigns of emperors you&amp;#39;ve heard of, like Justinian and Nikephoros Phokas, and those you might not have, like Heraclius or Michael the Amorian. The political scheming may be appropriately Byzantine (heh) but Robin steers you through it like an expert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The history of Bulgaria is often criminally overlooked. If you don&amp;#39;t believe me, give this show a listen. Think of this like the more relaxed cousin to the History of Byzantium, due to how often their stories coincide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Patrick Wyman&amp;#39;s earlier work, and just as premium quality as Tides. Rome is his specialty, you can tell that this is a topic that he is passionate and incredibly knowledgeable about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the barbarian tribes that plagued Rome to the Kaiser of the German Empire, Travis Dow is covering the history of the Germanic peoples who have played a central role in not just European, but global, history.

&lt;p&gt;Vikings are fun. This is an incontrovertible fact. I say this with a millennium or more to keep them away from me, since they&amp;#39;re still the baddies. I certainly wouldn&amp;#39;t want to be resident along any stretch of European water for roughly three centuries. Still, they&amp;#39;re fun to learn about, and Noah backs up his own knowledge and expertise with guest appearances from a variety of experts, from re-enactors to leading academics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that Poland is one of those countries that tends to get overlooked, except when it falls victim to one of its neighbours. Trevor does an amazing job at fixing that. Currently in the medieval era, Trevor has shown Poland unite, fall apart, reunite, adopt Christianity, reject Christianity, play kingmaker in Russia and play the diplomatic game with the Holy Roman Empire and Hungary. It is a genuine treat to see a new episode appear in my feed, and it will be the same for you.&lt;/p&gt;

But hey, a boring lunch-break and a free evening can do wonders! To be sure, this is not an expansive history of the sport across all countries, and neither is it one that looks at early schools of fencing nor more recent developments. Rather it is focused very specifically on the span of several decades in which fencing took shape as an actual, modern sport, a transition that while not solely so, was in large part indebted to the French. While the duel survived into the late 19th century in a number of countries, few saw it so broadly practiced and so intertwined with ideas of masculinity as the French of the Third Republic, and it was there that fencing as its own sport truly began to form and define itself.\n\n1871, for perhaps obvious reasons, was quite a low-point for France, and the newly born Third Republic. The recent defeat at the hands of Prussia and her allies might have had something to do with that. As is common in the face of defeat, attempts were made to salvage and salve the wounded pride of French manhood, crying out that the common French soldier had fought his bravest and shown honor on the battlefield, an effort made in vain under the poor quality of leadership and betrayal. The ashes of the Second Empire from which the Third Republic sprung sought, in large part, to revitalize the spirit of French honor, and to place at the forefront the image of the Republican man, a new bourgeois aristocracy of universal (male) suffrage and equality (which still, *of course*, excluded the uncouth lower-classes). An honorable man was brave, an honorable man was honest, an honorable man did not back down from a fight. The Republican man, as a man of honor, needed to be able to defend that honor. Ernest LeGouve summarize the sentiment in 1872:\n\n&gt;I would like our democracy to remain aristocratic in its manners and its sentiments, and nothing can achieve that end more effectively than familiarity with the sword.\n\nThe duel, or at least ones potential to fight one, quickly came to be intimately intertwined with public life for French men of any standing. Politicians were routinely expected to put steel behind their words spoken in the Chamber of Deputies, while journalists would expect to occasionally be called to account for what they printed on the page. While the rare duel was fought with pistols - ironically considered the most harmless form of the affair, both parties routinely shooting far wide, assuming the seconds had even loaded them with a real bullet instead of wax or simply powder - it was the épée de combat that any self-respecting Frenchman would need to familiarize himself with in anticipation of the fight. And to be sure, many men did fight them, and by the hundreds, but many more prepared for the duel that never came.\n\nWhile fencing - that is to say, swordplay for either practice or sport - has existed in some form or other essentially as long as the sword itself has, in few places can it be seen as becoming such an integral part of how manhood itself was defined - at least independent of the duel - than in France. While not entirely divorced from its more violent counterpart, which absolutely must be credited with its rise, fencing as sport and recreation became one of the most popular pastimes for the French bourgeois. While the épée was the weapon of the duel, and many men who anticipated finding themselves needing the knowledge would practice with the heavier weapon and its more deliberate style, the foil, a lighter weapon historically seen as a training blade, was the one of choice for most men frequenting the *salle d\'armes*, or fencing hall, in their evenings. While hardly a new innovation at the dawn of the Third Republic, Paris alone could boast of 100 Maître d’Armes in 1890, all graduated from the Military Academy at Joinville-les-Ponts, founded in 1872, whereas there had been only 35 in the country in 1870, and by that point too any town or city worth its salt soon was hosting a *salle*. By simple numbers, fencing was not the most popular sport in France, but few had nearly so much *meaning*, or institutional support.\n\n[A fencing salle of the late 19th century](https://i.redd.it/8od4fsejqve11.jpg)\n\nIn the late 19th century, the *salle* was one of the most fashionable places to be seen, and large businesses even began to maintain private ones for the use by their employees. Far from being a simple training for the duel, advocates saw countless good coming the embracing of the sport. It wasn\'t simply an activity to stay fit and active, although that in of itself was a selling point, but it was, as LeGouve wrote, a way to mold ""virile hearts and vigorous bodies"" from the newest generation of French manhood. Learning to fence was seen as part of the civilizing process, breeding respect between all men who practiced the art. It reinforced the equality of honor between all the participants, and helped to raise up and instill those values in newcomers to the scene. The rules of respect and politeness that continue to mark the rules of modern fencing were in large part formed and codified in these French *salles* during the the early Third Republic, with all men expected to follow them - and at least a few duels resulting when they weren\'t!\n\nOf course, the irony of all this sentiment of equality and brotherhood is that soon enough, many of the *salles* themselves came to be the exclusive domains of the connected and powerful. While there was always a hall available for the newly risen bourgeois looking to break into society, the best *salles*, houses in palatial quarters, with spas and lounges for the membership, were quote limited, with closely restricted memberships voted upon by the existing men and quite class conscious at that. And although some certainty felt that such opulent surroundings  were unsuited to these temples of sport and vigor, all generally felt some affinity and brotherhood in their chosen activity. They were all men of the sword, after all.\n\nThe process of divorcing itself from the duel was hardly overnight, and again, it must be said that not only did many a fencer consider the possibility - however remote - of their needing to put practice to the test, but duels from insults in the club were not unknown, and more than a few maître d’armes of a *salle* would provoke a duel with one of his compatriots, hoping to demonstrate his skill and drum up business, perhaps. But as can be expected with many an activity that gives the option of winner and loser, the continued sportification of fencing was all but unstoppable, and by the final decade of the 19th century, it truly can be said to have come into its own. Whereas in the \'assaults\' of earlier decades, scores were not kept, touches were always acknowledged, and it was simply a meeting of equals for a demonstration and mutual acknowledgement of their masculinity, it is at this point where this begins to fall to the wayside.\n\n[A demonstration match by masters at Cercle de la Rue Taitbout, one of the poshest salles in Paris. Lucien Merignac, left, a leader of the \'French\' school, and Cavairere Pini, right, one of the \'Italian\' masters, c. 1905](https://i.redd.it/40iwazc3pve11.png)\n\nSport competitions, with the keeping of score, performed for audiences, all became more common. Winners and losers were declared at the end of the bout. And while it remained in the rules for decades longer, the fact that fencers could *not* be counted on to always declare \'touché!\' meant the introduction of judges to ensure fair play was respected. A degree of artistry would remain part of the rules, but this itself came to be quantified, for some time a touch scored \'in style\' being worth more than one scored in an ugly manner. It also perhaps with some irony that observers of the time noted that the less tied to dueling the sport became, the greater in popularity the épée became as a sporting style. Lacking the artistry of foil, even in the 1870s it was seen by many as inappropriate for mere play - a ""prostitution"" of the art of fencing - and its practice intended mainly for those anticipating the duel. But by the turn of the century, such views had fallen to the wayside, and with not quite the popularity of the foil, it nevertheless had become an acceptable sporting choice as well.\n\nThe increasing involvement of women, too, speaks to the sportification, with more and more adventerous young ladies taking up the sport, following the argument of Alexandre Bergès 1896 ""*L\'Escrime er la femme""*, or a 1898 feminist writer in *La Fronde* that:\n\n&gt;fencing is a true art that requires calculation, precision and finesse rather than strength: Are these not the qualities that come most naturally to woman? And if she does not possess them, can she not easily acquire them?\n\n[A women\'s fencing class, c. 1889](https://i.redd.it/xtgzs380pve11.png)\n\n*La Fronde* put their money where their mouth was too, director Marguerite Durand installing a women-only gym in the office, which included a fencing piste. Whether women could *duel* of course was another matter, that facet of honor being generally seen as a much more *male* preserve but even then at least a few agreed with the argument of the fencing master M. Bouzier-Dorcières who noted that:\n\n&gt;\\[I\\]f we recognize that at the dawn of a new century, a feminist effort has formidably manifested itself in all countries, why do you want to deny a woman ... the right to avenge herself an offense that has been perpetrated against her.\n\n[Woman receiving fencing instruction, c. 1889](https://i.redd.it/a9xzsjpvove11.png)\n\nThis debate, of course, was far less settled, but while their right to duel was not generally acknowledged - a factor reflected in the restricting of women to foil, a training weapon, and excluded from épée, the sword of the duel - by the turn of the century fencing was an acceptable sport for the modern lady, a sport where success was not reliant on physical strength, but finesse and demeanor.\n\nAgain, while the duel could not be entirely separated, and even entered into discussions about women\'s involvement - fencing would continue to co-exist with the duel for decades longer, the duel in France only truly falling into decline after World War I - fencing was an established sport by the turn of the century. The French were not the lone practitioners of fencing, but certainly the most prominent, and at the forefront of its developments. Many of the manuals that became available in countries with less of a native tradition, such as the United States were at best heavily influenced, if not simply translations, of the French schools and style, and many a  fencing hall sought to find themselves a French master of arms to lead.\n\nI would take pause here of course, to mention the counter-arguments, as not all see the immediate acceptance of the duel as a symbol of Republican strength, and fencing as a direct outgrowth, and in truth it *would* be wrong to give the impression of such clarity. Some certainly saw the duel in the period not as an assertion of Republican values, but a continuation of earlier aristocratic privilege, a resistance to the culture of the Republic, although certainly still an attempt to revitalize masculinity for the defeated. For them, at least, the sportification of fencing was itself the ""Republicanization"" of the \'sword\', the true point where this meeting of manhood fell to the wayside, the nobility of it debassed, and ""\\[p\\]oints and prize money replac\\[ing\\] blood and honor"". For such purists - the same decrying especially the épée\'s sporting usage - the drive to *win* was simply incompatible with earlier visions of the \'art of fence\'. In this light too, it also must be said that the adoption of the duel in Republican spirit was, at least in part, an aping of that privilege, dating back a century to the time of the Revolution, part of a larger picture of the ""aristocratization of the bourgeoisie"" through the century, but also intertwined with the ""bourgeoisification of the aristocracy"".\n\nAn aristocrat himself, the Baron de Coubertin, the father of the Modern Olympics, was a dedicated fencer too, not to mention a product of the post-1871 generation, coming of age in the wake of defeat. His patronage of the sport helped at least in part its inclusion as an event, and in any event, it was French influenced rules used when fencing was included as one of the events of the inaugural modern Olympic Games in 1896, being contested for both foil and sabre, as well as a \'masters\' event, the lone professionals of the first games. Épée - or \'Dueling Sword\' as the event was often referred to still in that time - was planned, but when the foil event took too long, it was postponed and in the end never staged. It would have to wait till 1900 for its Olympic debut.\n\n[Fencing before the King of Greece, 1896 Olympic Games](https://i.redd.it/58tqtfhopve11.jpg)\n\nIn point of fact, the foil was entirely French affair as far as the international crowd went, bolstered by a large contingent of Greeks, and while the French took first and second the amateur event, it was likely with some chagrin that the Greek fencing master won the professional event, besting his French - and only - rival (Sport sabre had considerably less foothold in France, seen more as a military weapon still, and no Frenchmen competed in that event). In 1900, the French would do even better, but perhaps related to the fact that 211 of the 258 fencers at the Paris games were locals, still not enough to even get bronze in sabre though! French dominance would finally be broken at the 1904 games in St. Louis, although that in turn due to the fact none attended - exclusively a German, Cuban, and American affair. But even if they had not attended, there was few who doubted in that time that France was the true leader of the sport.\n\nIt would still takes time for the sport to gain uniformity, various countries following essentially their own ruleset, and several international conferences seeing little lasting result. Italy, nearly as attached to their more dueling influenced style as the French to theirs, undoubtedly put up the greatest resistance to French dominance of the \'meta\' game, leading to more than a few disagreements and boycotts of events. It all came to a head at the 1912 Games, where the French desired foil target to include the upper arm and withdrew when the Italians ensured this wouldn\'t happen, while the Italians in turn skipped épée when their desired length for the blade was not adopted. Things simple needed to be settled, and whatever Italian disagreement, the next year it would nevertheless be the French style predominantly followed for foil and épée (the Italo-Hungarian style and rules for sabre won out) following the formation of the Fédération Internationale d\'Escrime in 1913, not that disagreements didn\'t continue for decades longer. Although French domination of the sport would fall to the wayside in time, tradition still dictates French as the \'language of fencing\' internationally, an indelible mark of the sports origins and youth.\n\nNone of this is to undercut the contributions of other countries to the origins and early growth of the sport, of course. The development of sabre play, for instance, saw comparatively little impact from the French in the period who favored a much heavier blade ill-suited to development of the sport and destined to keep it unpopular for play. Late 19th to early 20th century sabre play instead owes much to the Italians and Hungarians, first among others who also bear mentioning like Poland and Austria. Nor should this even be taken to imply that the French alone were responsible for foil and épée, an affront the Italians, at the very least, would take personally. While they failed to find themselves in the drivers seat of developments in the early 20th century, they had their own bold style (generally seen as more embracing of the connection to the duel, as well) that would endure well past the adoption of the FIE rules in 1914, and they would surpass even the French in competitive success for much of the interwar period with it. But neither should any of that diminish the primacy of the French in the development of that period, no single country doing more to mold fencing in its infancy as a modern sport.\n\n**Sources**\n\n&gt;**Secondary Sources**\n\nBorysiuk, Zbigniew. *Modern Sabre Fencing*.

But hey, a boring lunch-break and a free evening can do wonders! To be sure, this is not an expansive history of the sport across all countries, and neither is it one that looks at early schools of fencing nor more recent developments. Rather it is focused very specifically on the span of several decades in which fencing took shape as an actual, modern sport, a transition that while not solely so, was in large part indebted to the French. While the duel survived into the late 19th century in a number of countries, few saw it so broadly practiced and so intertwined with ideas of masculinity as the French of the Third Republic, and it was there that fencing as its own sport truly began to form and define itself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1871, for perhaps obvious reasons, was quite a low-point for France, and the newly born Third Republic. The recent defeat at the hands of Prussia and her allies might have had something to do with that. As is common in the face of defeat, attempts were made to salvage and salve the wounded pride of French manhood, crying out that the common French soldier had fought his bravest and shown honor on the battlefield, an effort made in vain under the poor quality of leadership and betrayal. The ashes of the Second Empire from which the Third Republic sprung sought, in large part, to revitalize the spirit of French honor, and to place at the forefront the image of the Republican man, a new bourgeois aristocracy of universal (male) suffrage and equality (which still, &lt;em&gt;of course&lt;/em&gt;, excluded the uncouth lower-classes). An honorable man was brave, an honorable man was honest, an honorable man did not back down from a fight. The Republican man, as a man of honor, needed to be able to defend that honor. Ernest LeGouve summarize the sentiment in 1872:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I would like our democracy to remain aristocratic in its manners and its sentiments, and nothing can achieve that end more effectively than familiarity with the sword.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The duel, or at least ones potential to fight one, quickly came to be intimately intertwined with public life for French men of any standing. Politicians were routinely expected to put steel behind their words spoken in the Chamber of Deputies, while journalists would expect to occasionally be called to account for what they printed on the page. While the rare duel was fought with pistols - ironically considered the most harmless form of the affair, both parties routinely shooting far wide, assuming the seconds had even loaded them with a real bullet instead of wax or simply powder - it was the épée de combat that any self-respecting Frenchman would need to familiarize himself with in anticipation of the fight. And to be sure, many men did fight them, and by the hundreds, but many more prepared for the duel that never came.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While fencing - that is to say, swordplay for either practice or sport - has existed in some form or other essentially as long as the sword itself has, in few places can it be seen as becoming such an integral part of how manhood itself was defined - at least independent of the duel - than in France. While not entirely divorced from its more violent counterpart, which absolutely must be credited with its rise, fencing as sport and recreation became one of the most popular pastimes for the French bourgeois. While the épée was the weapon of the duel, and many men who anticipated finding themselves needing the knowledge would practice with the heavier weapon and its more deliberate style, the foil, a lighter weapon historically seen as a training blade, was the one of choice for most men frequenting the &lt;em&gt;salle d&amp;#39;armes&lt;/em&gt;, or fencing hall, in their evenings. While hardly a new innovation at the dawn of the Third Republic, Paris alone could boast of 100 Maître d’Armes in 1890, all graduated from the Military Academy at Joinville-les-Ponts, founded in 1872, whereas there had been only 35 in the country in 1870, and by that point too any town or city worth its salt soon was hosting a &lt;em&gt;salle&lt;/em&gt;. By simple numbers, fencing was not the most popular sport in France, but few had nearly so much &lt;em&gt;meaning&lt;/em&gt;, or institutional support.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://i.redd.it/8od4fsejqve11.jpg""&gt;A fencing salle of the late 19th century&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the late 19th century, the &lt;em&gt;salle&lt;/em&gt; was one of the most fashionable places to be seen, and large businesses even began to maintain private ones for the use by their employees. Far from being a simple training for the duel, advocates saw countless good coming the embracing of the sport. It wasn&amp;#39;t simply an activity to stay fit and active, although that in of itself was a selling point, but it was, as LeGouve wrote, a way to mold &amp;quot;virile hearts and vigorous bodies&amp;quot; from the newest generation of French manhood. Learning to fence was seen as part of the civilizing process, breeding respect between all men who practiced the art. It reinforced the equality of honor between all the participants, and helped to raise up and instill those values in newcomers to the scene. The rules of respect and politeness that continue to mark the rules of modern fencing were in large part formed and codified in these French &lt;em&gt;salles&lt;/em&gt; during the the early Third Republic, with all men expected to follow them - and at least a few duels resulting when they weren&amp;#39;t!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, the irony of all this sentiment of equality and brotherhood is that soon enough, many of the &lt;em&gt;salles&lt;/em&gt; themselves came to be the exclusive domains of the connected and powerful. While there was always a hall available for the newly risen bourgeois looking to break into society, the best &lt;em&gt;salles&lt;/em&gt;, houses in palatial quarters, with spas and lounges for the membership, were quote limited, with closely restricted memberships voted upon by the existing men and quite class conscious at that. And although some certainty felt that such opulent surroundings  were unsuited to these temples of sport and vigor, all generally felt some affinity and brotherhood in their chosen activity. They were all men of the sword, after all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The process of divorcing itself from the duel was hardly overnight, and again, it must be said that not only did many a fencer consider the possibility - however remote - of their needing to put practice to the test, but duels from insults in the club were not unknown, and more than a few maître d’armes of a &lt;em&gt;salle&lt;/em&gt; would provoke a duel with one of his compatriots, hoping to demonstrate his skill and drum up business, perhaps. But as can be expected with many an activity that gives the option of winner and loser, the continued sportification of fencing was all but unstoppable, and by the final decade of the 19th century, it truly can be said to have come into its own. Whereas in the &amp;#39;assaults&amp;#39; of earlier decades, scores were not kept, touches were always acknowledged, and it was simply a meeting of equals for a demonstration and mutual acknowledgement of their masculinity, it is at this point where this begins to fall to the wayside.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://i.redd.it/40iwazc3pve11.png""&gt;A demonstration match by masters at Cercle de la Rue Taitbout, one of the poshest salles in Paris.

But neither should any of that diminish the primacy of the French in the development of that period, no single country doing more to mold fencing in its infancy as a modern sport.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sources&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secondary Sources&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Borysiuk, Zbigniew. &lt;em&gt;Modern Sabre Fencing&lt;/em&gt;.

I've been watching Hitler:Circle Of Evil, a really good Netflix documentary on the inner circle of the Third Reich. I am on Episode 4 with deals mainly with the start of the war and Hess's fall from power and influence, ending with his failed mission into England and subsequent capture.

I knew the basics of the story, that he went to England, got captured and spent the rest of the war in a British prison. I didn't know a lot of the details like who he was going to see. According to the documentary he thought if he spoke to the Duke Of Hamilton, a British noble who he met in Germany in 1936 during the Olympics, he could get an audience with Churchill to discuss a peace deal.

Obviously that isn't what happened. Hess spends the entire war in prison. There was an inquiry about it in Parliament but he was found to have no knowledge of the plot.So i get he faced no official governmental punishment. What i was wondering about is if being associated with Hess affected his business or personal life. People might not want to attend a party hosted by the guy who was chums with the Deputy Fuhrer. I know he was an aviator, so maybe a company might not want to sell planes to a guy who was buddies with Hess. I was just curious about that.

&lt;p&gt;And since the automoderator will remove this post if I don’t unnecessarily expand on my question. I did research on my question and couldn’t find anything of use. I read The Twelve Caesars years ago but I don’t remember whether or not it answers my question. I doubt it does since it’s an ancient biography about people related to my question.&lt;/p&gt;

Also with paintings, they sometimes have to repaint over damaged or faded areas. Statues will have missing pieces created and attached.

So yesterday I 'discovered' that aside from the Pyramids and the Sphinx at Giza, the have also uncovered a shaft half way between the Sphinx and the Pyramids beneath the causeway of King Khafre. Herodotus first mentioned it, but it was written off as Herodotus embellishing history. In 1945 it was 'discovered' (I use the term lightly because the locals had been swimming in it and drinking the fresh water from it) by  Abdel Moneim Abu Bakr, however it was only completely drained and excavated in 1999 by Zahi Hawass.   


Basically it's an ancient shrine to Osiris at Giza, the majority of the finds are from the 26th Dynasty, however in the oldest level they also found pottery sherds from the 6th Dynasty. 

Anyways, the find is really cool and I've had a lot of trouble finding primary and secondary sources on it which aren't 'ancient aliens' or sensationalising the find. I couldn't even find information on it on my university's library search engine. However, I did a bit of digging and found this:   


[Here](http://www.gizapyramids.org/pdf_library/hawass_fs_oconnor.pdf) is a link to the book chapter in which an Hawass has published his excavation report, and [here ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hg-mLcA-GE)is a link to a Fox interview (where I initially learned of the find) with Zahi Hawass where he leads the reporter through the three levels of the shaft. For the video I skipped to 6:23 in because the presenter started rabbiting on about ancient aliens and conspiracy theories, and at the 6:30 mark Hawass begins his tour of the complex.   


The Giza Pyramids site from where I linked the book excerpt isn't a dodgy new-age site, it's a comprehensive site put together by the Museum of Fine arts Boston.

Just reading random wiki pages, and I came across the 2 pages: [Deluge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deluge_(history)) and [Battle of Vienna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Vienna)

If my understanding is right, Poland suffer greatly from the raid from the Swedish around 1655 and it marks the demise of the commonwealth, yet somehow the Polish is still able to mobilize a large enough army to relief the siege of Vienna in 1683. 

Here are a few question I would like to raise:

1. Did the Polish army suffer heavy casualty during their war with the Swedish and Russian during the Deluge? Or was it only civilians' life being lost?
2. What happen in between these 30 years? Was there a peace treaty signed allowing the Polish to recover to its former glory or were there just constant harassments from the Swedish?
3. Why would the Polish King decided to aid Austria? Didn't he fear the Swedish menacing from the north while the Polish main force was in Vienna?

As a more serious large subreddit it takes a lot of work to maintain /r/history. This also means that we are always looking to add a few more mods to the /r/history team. 
So we always have a link in our sidebar [to the moderator application page](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/mod_application) so people that are interested in becoming a mod can apply there.
However we also like to every once in a while draw a bit more attention to this process, which is why we made this post. This post gives the same information as on the linked wiki page, but it also allows you to ask questions about being a mod. 

## What do we expect from \/r/history moderators?

Here is a quick overview of the general things we are looking for: 

- **Experienced with reddit and \/r/history:** We are looking for experienced redditors who have been active on reddit with an account that is at least 1 year old. In addition to that we are looking for people who have contributed productively to this community. 
- **A firm interest in history:** We want people that are interested in the subject, so obviously you need to have a firm interest in history. 
- **Communicative towards users and fellow moderators:** You will communicate with other users on a regular basis, for this you need to be communicative, mature and civil. Lots of mod decisions are discussed in our backroom subreddit, modmail and discord, so you will need to be able to work well together with the other team members. 
- **Free time:** You don't need to have a ton of time on your hands, but when you get accepted you should have enough time to actually carry out moderating duties. 
- **Thick skin:** history is a subject people often try to use to push their agenda. When they are not allowed to do so they can get rather nasty. 
- **Willingness to install and use third party tools:** This includes browser extensions aimed at mods as found on /r/toolbox which are essential for moderating as well as using applications for chatting with the team on discord. 

Some of the responsibilities include: 

- Review unmoderated links and modqueue reports and remove off topic and rule breaking content.
- Answer subscriber questions in modmail.
- Enforce sidebar rules.

If you have no idea how moderating works on reddit and want to check out more about that first you can have a look at [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/creesch/wiki/historymod101).

## What do I get in return? 

There is no monetary reward as it is all volunteer work. However you do get a better subreddit in return and a very friendly team work with. 
All of the mods are here because they love history and as such they want this subreddit to succeed in focusing on history and the discussion surrounding it. It is one of the reasons we always try to attract new moderators from within the /r/history community. 

## Great, how do I apply? 

You can do so [through this link](https://goo.gl/forms/jY5dBCGgwKgaTxID2), we will ask a few questions we will use in the application process. Take the time to answer them. As rule of thumb if all your answers are one line long it is very unlikely that you'll be considered. 

## How long will the applications be open for? 

We are always looking for new moderators so there is no end date as it is an ongoing process.

## Good luck!

The /r/history moderating team.

## Wait, I have a different question about being a mod!?

Feel free to post your question below and we'll answer it.

It is one of the reasons we always try to attract new moderators from within the &lt;a href=""/r/history""&gt;/r/history&lt;/a&gt; community. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Great, how do I apply?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can do so &lt;a href=""https://goo.gl/forms/jY5dBCGgwKgaTxID2""&gt;through this link&lt;/a&gt;, we will ask a few questions we will use in the application process. Take the time to answer them. As rule of thumb if all your answers are one line long it is very unlikely that you&amp;#39;ll be considered. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How long will the applications be open for?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are always looking for new moderators so there is no end date as it is an ongoing process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Good luck!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=""/r/history""&gt;/r/history&lt;/a&gt; moderating team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Wait, I have a different question about being a mod!?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feel free to post your question below and we&amp;#39;ll answer it. &lt;/p&gt;

I'm trying to see if there is any interest floating around out here on the internet in a dedicated History of Persia podcast.

It was pretty disappointing to discover only about 20 episodes across a half dozen different podcasts that were even related. It was even worse to realize that the only dedicated Persia podcast out there is the now abandoned History of Iran (which barely makes it to Cyrus the Great) and Dan Carlin's King of Kings series, which is short, relative to the long form narrative podcasts that are out there for a lot of other places.

As it's my area of study, and I have a fair amount of reading to do on Persia to begin with I have been thinking about rectifying the situation and tackling this project myself. That said, I want to see if there is an audience out there before I take the time (and money) to seriously do additional research, compile scripts, buy equipment, etc. So, let me know.

I know these empires were stable were, but how could they be? Why weren't there cases where lots of cases 'the wrong people' were made for a looong time without being recognised?
 
* Most clearly, I can see this slave-holding practise work where blacks are slaves to whites. Race would be a clear delineator of what would make a slave. Only liberated slaves would have to worry constantly, but that needn't worry the white slaveholders. 
* I can see it work in situations where local kingdoms fight each other and the winner takes soldiers and villagers they conquered and brands them as slaves.
 
But in places like the Roman empire, where everyone within the empire can be made a slave, how would that work? If a wealthy man is taken hostage and transported overseas and sold as a slave..who would check his story?? Trust the testament of a mere slave, having to travel all that way to verify? I have never heard people worrying about this, but it seems like a problem that could be interesting to address. Another hypothetical: if you have a dispute with a neighbour, can't he arrange a gang to kidnap you and sell you to a slave holder and get some money to pay off the gang, as well as having something for himself and having gotten rid of that neighbour he hates? Sure, it may not be practical, but I don't really see how such a system of imperial slavery would make me feel secure.
 
If the Romans enslaved the people that they conquered and kept it as that, it'd be fine, that be somewhat similar to the black/white distinction, since there are some ethnic differences between Romans and Gauls, Egyptian, Britons, Thracians, or Berbers. But as soon as you allow them citizenship (which seems somewhat necessary to keep a large empire afloat - there are only so many ethnic Romans to fill the slots in the newly conquered territories), it seems you'll run into the problems I've described above.
 
---
 
I'm also interested in the question of: why didn't technology develop earlier and, when it did, why didn't it develop faster than it did - in the time there was slavery. I'm aware of the sort of economical argument: if there's more work to be done, just get more slaves, no need in investing in these new technologies to make the slaves more productive (or even replace them). But that seems somewhat lame to me. It's not as if their slave labour could not be used elsewhere. You could use the farm and mine slaves to build and decorate houses better and faster, to serve food, boost other goods that increase trade. Even the Steam engine that the romans seem to have invented wouldn't mean slaves where no longer necessary, there would've still been a need for slaves to gather the fuel, to man the machines, transport the goods, serve and bathe the free elite. This argument seems a little lacking for me. But that may just have been hindsight, and with consistent pro-science attitude, we could've seen the space age during the ..idk,,400s if only the ancient Greeks stepped up their Antikythera mechanism game a little.

However, neither of them had links, and searching proved fruitless. Reading the rest of Hannibal's page mentioned the war in a single throwaway paragraph, mainly drawing attention to the fact that Rome (Pergamon's ally) threatened Bithynia into giving him up, which they did.

The source for that paragraph was from Cornelius Nepos' *Excellentium Imperatorum Vitae* (Lives of the Eminent Commanders). In it, he tells a story about how Hannibal prepared for the upcoming naval battle with King Eumenes, in which Hannibal was vastly outnumbered. He had the men fill earthen jugs with venomous snakes; as many as they could find. When the battle began, both sides lined up against each other, and Hannibal sent out a messenger in a dinghy. This messenger claimed he was seeking audience with the king, so he was taken before him and presented the king with a letter, then promptly left. When the king opened the letter, he found there was nothing in it but insults.

What was the point of this? Hannibal now knew which ship the enemy king was on. The Bithynians charged that one ship, causing a rout. The rest of the Pergamese fleet engaged the Bithynians, but they suddenly had earthen jars thrown onto their decks, which first confused, then amused, then terrified the sailors as the snakes fell out and went crazy.

My grandfather served in the US Army during WW2 and returned with a German soldier's ID Disc. This was all the way back after the conclusion of the war. We have no idea how he came across these as he did not speak much of his time overseas.

He was deemed MIA then later as a POW in WW1, however, I do not know much about his service in WW2. **My hope is to help ID any surviving family members and return the ID disc to them.**

Please help me solve this mystery!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My grandfather served in the US Army during WW2 and returned with a German soldier&amp;#39;s ID Disc. This was all the way back after the conclusion of the war. We have no idea how he came across these as he did not speak much of his time overseas. After some research I have uncovered that this belonged to a soldier who was in both WW1 and WW2 surviving both conflicts. He was deemed MIA then later as a POW in WW1, however, I do not know much about his service in WW2. &lt;strong&gt;My hope is to help ID any surviving family members and return the ID disc to them.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is what I have so far:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Name: Hans Stix  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Religion: roman catholic  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Residence (~ 1916): Weiden, BA Lichtenfels   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Born: 30.12.1898 in Weiden  &lt;/p&gt;

Is there a book about the political history of the world, as in detailing rulers, presidents, etc?

In this book are the leaders ""graded"" like American Presidents seem to be? Like the pros and cons of said leaders.

Example:

***Bubba Chuck Thornton****, Grand Poobah of Appalachia*

*Overview: Born into poverty, Thornton rose quickly to the top of Appalachia's political echelon during the 1880's. After the War of the Factions, Thornton was elected Grand Poobah; a position he held for eight years.*

*Pros: Thornton had a charismatic flair that would get even the most obstinate opponent to listen. He handled the prosecution of the conclusion of the  War of the Factions extremely well, more so than his opponents. He raised taxes because Appalachia  needed to rebuild after the conflict and he thought it was best for the people.*

*Cons: Thornton was a notorious drinker and womanizer. He had numerous affairs, and may have even been implicated in an embezzlement scheme. All of these things, however, came to light after he left office in 1892. His foreign policies regarding the Kingdom of Ouachita were seen as controversial and may have caused relationships between the two nations to freeze.*

***Bubba Chuck Thornton***

*1857-1902*

*Domestic Policy: Fair to good, Thornton raised taxes in order for the economy to move again.*

*Foreign Policy: Poor. Thornton neglected his ties to strengthen the alliance between Appalachia and Ouachita. This caused several problems; the largest being import tariffs.*

I know it's just an example, but I could've sworn there was a book about all of the worlds leaders, giving capsule summaries of their achievements and/or failures. Not exactly a biography, but giving a brief summary of what they did. r/https://www.rulers.org could be an example of this.

1: The composition of a fort wall, let's take fort Ticonderoga for example

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Ticonderoga#Construction

&gt;The walls were seven feet (2.1 meters) high and fourteen feet (4.3 meters) thick ... they were made of squared wooden timbers, with earth filling the gap. The French then began to dress the walls with stone...

Not limiting to fort Ticonderoga, but for all the Bastion Forts in that era, what's the typical stone:earth ratio of these walls are? What types of stones were typically used

2: How effective are these forts against siege weapons? Where there effective ways to destroy the walls directly?

From what I understand, in that period, field artillery uses solid shots, which are probably not effective against thick walls like these. ""Siege artillery"" like mortars fires larger shells. Made of cast iron, filled with black powder. I have only seen modern shell vs concrete fortification stuff, but haven't found any data on how well do black powder shells do against the walls, if any of you have materials on this, please share

3: I read that these forts were pretty effective against direct assault, usually it takes the invading force many times more people  to attack it with infantry. Or it takes long sieges/long term bombardment of the fort. Has there been any incidents that a fort is directly destroyed/heavily damaged in a frontal attack?

He mentions how the Ancient Chinese divided the steppe peoples into the 'cooked' and the 'uncooked', the latter being the truly wild and savage ones, and the Chinese foreign policy being primarily to 'cook' any hostile invaders as quickly as possible.

But Carlin mentions that the Steppe societies also recognized this problem. In ep 1., Wrath of the Khans, he says that after seeing how Mongols really lost their edge (Kublai Khan, etc), ""subsequent steppe civilizations made an effort to bring their men back to the steppe, in order to retain their edge."" Unfortunately he doesn't explain this any further. Was this the Timurids? Maybe the Golden Horde? The Kazakh Khanate?

This was raised [in a prior thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/dancarlin/comments/650wur/in_one_of_the_podcasts_dan_mentions_that_the/), but without a good answer:

1. It was suggested that Kublai Khan sent Mongols back to the steppe during the conquest of China; but no evidence was given, and it's well known that Kublai Khan in fact championed the abandonment of the nomadic Mongol lifestyle. Maybe there's something about this in Marco Polo, but I've seen nothing so far.
2. The same person attributes this 'back to the steppe' idea to Jack Weatherford, but Weatherford's book is short and very sketchy, and having read it back to back, I haven't found any reference of this.

So can any resident experts on this provide a hint? /u/The_Jackmeister

EDIT: No leads so far. It's been asked whether retreating to the steppe would even be necessary. We know that the later Mongols were pitifully incapable of enduring extreme conditions in pursuit of victory; under Genghis Khan, those same Mongols would eat raw animal intestine, squeezing out the dreck like a toothpaste tube. But I need only to point to a Mongol named Ariq Böke, the main challenger to the soft liberal Kublai Khan. He literally called Kublai out for going effeminate, and insisted the Mongols must return to their nomadic roots if they were to retain their empire. Ariq and Kublai had a Mongol Civil War; Kublai won, became pudgy, developed a gout, and learned to be fluent in Chinese... Surely this wouldn't be lost on the future steppe/nomadic khans. Carlin's point that the khans would seek to retain their hard edge seems plausible, but we just need to find the evidence.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dan Carlin&amp;#39;s Wrath of the Khans has a prominent theme that the the steppe/nomadic societies were only ferocious if they retained their nomadic culture.

Was this the Timurids? Maybe the Golden Horde? The Kazakh Khanate?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was raised &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/dancarlin/comments/650wur/in_one_of_the_podcasts_dan_mentions_that_the/""&gt;in a prior thread&lt;/a&gt;, but without a good answer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was suggested that Kublai Khan sent Mongols back to the steppe during the conquest of China; but no evidence was given, and it&amp;#39;s well known that Kublai Khan in fact championed the abandonment of the nomadic Mongol lifestyle. Maybe there&amp;#39;s something about this in Marco Polo, but I&amp;#39;ve seen nothing so far.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The same person attributes this &amp;#39;back to the steppe&amp;#39; idea to Jack Weatherford, but Weatherford&amp;#39;s book is short and very sketchy, and having read it back to back, I haven&amp;#39;t found any reference of this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So can any resident experts on this provide a hint? &lt;a href=""/u/The_Jackmeister""&gt;/u/The_Jackmeister&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: No leads so far. It&amp;#39;s been asked whether retreating to the steppe would even be necessary. We know that the later Mongols were pitifully incapable of enduring extreme conditions in pursuit of victory; under Genghis Khan, those same Mongols would eat raw animal intestine, squeezing out the dreck like a toothpaste tube. But I need only to point to a Mongol named Ariq Böke, the main challenger to the soft liberal Kublai Khan. He literally called Kublai out for going effeminate, and insisted the Mongols must return to their nomadic roots if they were to retain their empire. Ariq and Kublai had a Mongol Civil War; Kublai won, became pudgy, developed a gout, and learned to be fluent in Chinese... Surely this wouldn&amp;#39;t be lost on the future steppe/nomadic khans. Carlin&amp;#39;s point that the khans would seek to retain their hard edge seems plausible, but we just need to find the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

First post here!

I've recently gained quite an interest in the Yugoslav wars, which has led to my wanting to buy a couple uniforms and surplus supplies from the internet.

I'm relatively new to collecting militaria and I'm finding it difficult deciding what to buy.

My one problem is that there was so much variation to the uniforms during the war. This I'm assuming was the case due to the amounts of volunteer groups involved in Bosnia. When looking at photos of the conflict I can even spot different patterns of helmets and uniforms in the same image which is very confusing.

I've already bought a M59/85 helmet (I've gathered that it's that model due to the removable lining but its still made from metal not kevlar), it still had the star decal but I am more interested in what appears to be the cross of Republica Srpska that has been scratched onto the star.

I'm guessing it belonged to a Bosnian Serb fighter, so I want to know what other pieces of uniform I could buy to complete the collection. Primarily it's a choice between the ""Tiger Stripe"" patterns, M89 and M93 patterns.

So, who wore what? What was more commonly used in Bosnia and what should I look for?

&lt;p&gt;Maybe this is too broad a question, and I can narrow it in scope if necessary, but I was thinking recently about some of the crazy distances traveled by trade goods in the ancient world: Chinese silk in Rome, Greek-looking statues in Afghanistan, Japanese goods of all sorts as far as Persia, etc. It made me curious: did any trade ever cross over from the Americas into the ancient world? Are there artifacts that have been found in far-flung societies such as Persia or Greece from the Aelutians or even indigenous tribes of Canada/the U.S.?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance!&lt;/p&gt;

*Notes for Those Going on Leave -* featured in Beevor's *Stalingrad* on p46, but originaly found in the Central Archive of the Ministry of Defense, Podolsk. Written by most likely a group of Wehrmacht troops during the brutal winter of fighting following Germany's failure to take Moscow. 



*On Returning to Germany:* 'You must remember that you are entering a National Socialist country whose living conditions are very different to those to which you have become accustomed. You must be tactful with the inhabitants, adapting to their customs and refrain from the habits which you have come to love so much'.

*Food:* 'Do not rip up the parquet or other kinds of floor, because potatoes are kept in a different place.' 

*Curfew:* If you forget your key, try to open the door with the round-shaped object. Only in cases of extreme urgency use a grenade.' 

*Defence against Partisans:* 'It is not necessary to ask civilians the password and open fire on receiving an unsatisfactory answer.'

*Defence against Animals: '*Dogs with mines attached to them are a special feature of the Soviet Union. German dogs in the worst cases bite, but they do not explode. Shooting every dog you see, although recoemmended in the Soviet Union, might create a bad impression.' 

*Relations with the Civil Population: '*In Germany just because somebody is wearing women's clothes does not necessarily mean that she is a partisan. But in spite of this, they are dangerous for anyone on leave from the front.' 

*General: '*When back on leave in the Fatherland take care not to talk about the paradise existence in the Soviet Union in case everybody wants to come here and spoil our idyllic comfort.'

This passage has stuck with me for months after the first time I read the book.

My dad and his sisters are trying to get their Italian passport. As I have been following this process I found out about this big drama in my family history.  My great-great-grandfather came to Brazil with his family when he was a child. Turns out his family didn't like Brazil, which is understandable, because things were kinda shitty over here by then. Some years passed by, and they gathered enough money to buy the tickets to go back to Italy. However, in the meantime, my great-great-grandfather fell in love with my great-great-grandmother and didn't want to go back to Italy. They had a big fight about it, and his family completely abandoned him, and left him in Brazil with only the clothes on his back. Since then my great-great-grandfather refused to talk about his family to any of his sons and grandsons, completely cutting any ties with them. His marriage certificate states that his parents are unknown, and there is no document that establish any sort of tie with his family. Also, no record can be found of anyone with our/his family name immigrating to Brazil.


Recently, we have been wondering how could that be that a son would be left behind alone in a foreign country with nothing. No heritage, nothing at all. It is also very strange that my great-great-grandfather would  part ways with his family like that and show no remorse at all, ever. My grandfather, who is still alive, says his granfather was adopted after being abandoned in a foundling wheel or something like that in Italy. Still, that alone doesn't explain the abandonment.

We have then theorized that my great-great-grandfather  probably didn't have many affection with his family, maybe because he was treated like a servant or something like that and would have not had the same rights as his adoptive brothers. He probably didn't have any good memories about his foster family. That explains how he could just leave his family and be left like that. He didn't know who his parents were, and wouldn't put his foster parents name in his marriage certificate. He may have made up his family name, or he could have a different last name than his foster family's. That explains why there is no record of his entrance in Brazil (they only registered the father's name and if he had any family or children with him). This explains a lot. But I am not sure it makes sense in the historical context.

In order to try to enlight this question, I have come to this thread, as I was unable to find any useful information about it by myself on the internet. Maybe some of you may point me a direction or have any insight of how can I find this information. So here are some of the questions I am trying to answer:

How did adoption work on the lake 19th century in Italy? Was it common for kids to be adopted? Did adoptive sons have any kind of rights by then? Was it common for adopted kids to be mistreated by their foster family? Did the adopted sons usually inherit their last names from their foster family?

My grandfather, who is still alive, says his granfather was adopted after being abandoned in a foundling wheel or something like that in Italy. Still, that alone doesn&amp;#39;t explain the abandonment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have then theorized that my great-great-grandfather  probably didn&amp;#39;t have many affection with his family, maybe because he was treated like a servant or something like that and would have not had the same rights as his adoptive brothers. He probably didn&amp;#39;t have any good memories about his foster family. That explains how he could just leave his family and be left like that. He didn&amp;#39;t know who his parents were, and wouldn&amp;#39;t put his foster parents name in his marriage certificate. He may have made up his family name, or he could have a different last name than his foster family&amp;#39;s. That explains why there is no record of his entrance in Brazil (they only registered the father&amp;#39;s name and if he had any family or children with him). This explains a lot. But I am not sure it makes sense in the historical context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to try to enlight this question, I have come to this thread, as I was unable to find any useful information about it by myself on the internet. Maybe some of you may point me a direction or have any insight of how can I find this information. So here are some of the questions I am trying to answer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How did adoption work on the lake 19th century in Italy? Was it common for kids to be adopted? Did adoptive sons have any kind of rights by then? Was it common for adopted kids to be mistreated by their foster family? Did the adopted sons usually inherit their last names from their foster family?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR: Big drama about my great-great-grandfather and his foster family. Trying to know more information about adoption in Italy in the late 19th century.&lt;/p&gt;

I have been working on my genealogy and perhaps this is a good place to start looking for and gleaning some answers about my questions. I find myself interested in the collateral history going on with my ancestors that perhaps influenced them in various ways, particularly when they moved... this brings me to my inquiry:

Many people seemed to have migrated to Tennessee that came from NC, SC, VA, and Pennsylvania before during and just after the war of 1812. I have been doing my own historical research and understand that Daniel Boone was prominent in this area and was one of the first to take a party to explore and establish forts in the area, as well as other militia men who were building forts in the area. Fort Blackmore is of interest. It seems to me that the Hatfield patriarch and company were a part of this time and political affiliation. I learned that the Hatfields and neighbors seemed to have been fighting for land rights, well before the civil war, and also that many many families had very bad disputes in court about how Mr. Prominent died leaving his daughter land only to be abused by another Mr. Prominent who seemed to have only married her for her land and to be more important in the area. There was multiple marriages, kids, and debauchery going on but it seemed to be more tied to politics and government influence with marriage and land laws than what today is largely written off as ""hillbilly nonsense"". This brings me to my question: 

When researching the Appalachian area, and early America in general, how can I apply what I learned in school to make sense of the complexities and nuances that I tend to be finding? For example, I guess I don't understand the war of 1812 still after reading about my own people's activities during their time in the militia: someone was arguing with Andrew Jackson about the enlisting agreement, and Jackson County, Tennessee was named for him, with many folks in my family not really caring about the war but the rewards for participating in it: the land that seemed to be given as pension afterward. Where/How can I understand how the land was divided and the more intricate understandings of the war and the how the militias were organized, and why, and REALLY what were the people like in them: I am just finding basically two different understandings and would like to be able to tie it all together in my mind more clearly. 

Can anyone help me with this? Either tips about what I'm trying to do in general, or gleanings from this time period/era/war and/or anything you think may help me with my research!! Thanks in advance, and I understand this may be a bit broad and at the same time very particular, so my apologies if this isn't exactly the best question to ask in these parts but I figured if anywhere, you all could chime in and help me along in my discoveries and studies!!!

[I made this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/915r34/my_grandfather_was_a_pow_in_russia_how_were_his/) over at r/AskHistorians and it seems to be of interest for the community - sadly the mods have removed every single comment as they were not in depth enough; also I'm feeling that other people don't want to comment because of that (I received some PMs instead). Sooo yeah maybe some of you guys here have some info on the matter.

Here's the post:

&gt;My Grandfather fought in the German 6th Army and took active part in the battle of Stalingrad. As far as I know he was the driver of an artillery truck or something of the like. He survived but was taken as POW and imprisoned until late 1947 (EDIT: I don't really know when he was taken captive, probably early 1943). Sadly he passed away long before I was even born. He never talked much about the war or his years in captivity, according to my father. When he returned home he proceeded to work the same job he did before the war as a mine worker. He died in 1985, at the age of 69.  
&gt;  
&gt;I would like to get to know more about what these men went through. Where were the soldiers of the 6th Army brought to? How were their living conditions? They certainly had to do slave-like work every day, what did they do? Why did it take several years after the war ended until the prisoners were released? I've read somewhere that the very last German soldiers were released in 1955?! As far as I know my grandfather had to walk or hitchhike the whole way from Russia to Germany, was that usually the case?  
&gt;  
&gt;My grandmother died in 2008 and I regret not having an interest in WWII back then, she might have had some stories to tell. During the war she worked as a nurse in some sort of military hospital in Cologne.  
&gt;  
&gt;The fact that my grandfather refused to talk much about the war for more than 30 years tells its very own tale, but I’d really appreciate any insight about what he might have experienced.

Thanks :)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone,&lt;/p&gt;

Questions to answer:

1. Should we start our own sub for history book club?

2. Should we all read the same book, or should we pick a subject, time period, region, historical figure, etc and each of us reads something about the topic?

3. Time, in general: When do we start? How long do we get to read our books? (Bear in mind that history books are usually longer and denser than fiction.)

For most of his post war life he did not talk about his experiences during the Holocaust.  Over the last couple of years he has opened up about his experiences.  Recently I discussed videoing an interview with him about his experiences during WWII and he agreed. He also said it would be OK to post the interview on youtube when finished.   I have been working on some questions and figured I would post them here to get some advice and feedback.  I will now provide a little background about my uncle and then I will post my questions in three parts, pre-war, war, and post war.


My uncle grew up in Slovakia and was the youngest male out of a family 8.  When Germany invaded Slovakia, his parents and his youngest sister were sent to Auschwitz with him.  His parents were sent to the gas chambers and he and his sister were sent to work in the camp.  After surviving Auschwitz he spent time convalescing from a broken back in a full body cast.  After that he met up with his sister, who also survived Auschwitz, and a brother who was a partisan fighter.  Eventually he made it to the USA where my grandmother who immigrated before the war already was.  


Below are the questions I have already come up with.  


**Pre-War life**:


Where did you grow up?

Describe your family.  

What did your father do for a living? 

What were your living conditions like growing up?

Did you experience anti-semitism growing up in Spisska Bela?

When did you become aware of the Nazi party?

When did you become aware that Slovakia was going to invaded by the Germans?


**World War II**:


When did the Nazis arrive in your hometown?  Can you describe what happened to you and your family?

What happened when you first arrived to Auschwitz?

What was your day to day life like in Auschwitz?

How were you treated by the guards?

Could you describe your living conditions?

What did you do to survive daily life?

What was your job in the camp?  Did you have more than one?

What was the closest you ever came to dying in Auschwitz?

How did you psychologically cope with the day to day life in the camp?

Was there any one moment that stood out above all others?

What lucky moments helped you survive?

Did you receive help from other prisoners,  civilians, or guards?

Were there any deaths of fellow inmates that affected you more than others?

When did you realize that Nazi’s were going to lose the war?

When did you come to realize that you would be leaving Auschwitz?

Can you describe you final days there and the process of being set free?


**Post War:** 


What happened immediately after you left Auschwitz?

Were you able to get in contact with any surviving family members?  What about family members that had immigrated before the war?

How did you feel when you learned about the fate of your family?

Did you return to Spisska Bela?  What was that like?

How long did you spend as a refugee before you were able to come to America?

Can you describe day to day life as refugee?

When did you arrive tin the USA?

Were you treated differently in the USA because you were a holocaust survivor?

Have you had any symptoms of post traumatic stress from the war like nightmares or flashbacks?  

How did you decide to address your experiences in the War with your children?

I know you were good friends with Hugo Princz?  Would you like to talk about his lawsuit against the German government?

Do you have any message for future generations about the Holocaust?

Do you have an opinion about Holocaust deniers?



My uncle is in amazing condition for his age and his mind is sharp.  I'm hoping to use my interview questions to help him recall as much as he can about his experiences.  Please feel free to respond with your own questions or critiques of the question I have already asked.  Thank you in advance for all your help.  I will try to respond to any questions but if this blows up(who knows) I may not get back to all the questions.  I hope to do the interview in the next couple of weeks but I don't know when I will be posting it to youtube.  I'll make sure to post a link to the interview when I'm finished.  I'm using an alt account for this post in case anyone cares.

*Edited to make the post a little more readable. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have a 93 year old great uncle who survived Auschwitz.  For most of his post war life he did not talk about his experiences during the Holocaust.  Over the last couple of years he has opened up about his experiences.  Recently I discussed videoing an interview with him about his experiences during WWII and he agreed. He also said it would be OK to post the interview on youtube when finished.   I have been working on some questions and figured I would post them here to get some advice and feedback.  I will now provide a little background about my uncle and then I will post my questions in three parts, pre-war, war, and post war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My uncle grew up in Slovakia and was the youngest male out of a family 8.  When Germany invaded Slovakia, his parents and his youngest sister were sent to Auschwitz with him.  His parents were sent to the gas chambers and he and his sister were sent to work in the camp.  After surviving Auschwitz he spent time convalescing from a broken back in a full body cast.  After that he met up with his sister, who also survived Auschwitz, and a brother who was a partisan fighter.  Eventually he made it to the USA where my grandmother who immigrated before the war already was.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are the questions I have already come up with.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pre-War life&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where did you grow up?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Describe your family.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What were your living conditions like growing up?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you experience anti-semitism growing up in Spisska Bela?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When did you become aware of the Nazi party?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When did you become aware that Slovakia was going to invaded by the Germans?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;World War II&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When did the Nazis arrive in your hometown?  Can you describe what happened to you and your family?&lt;/p&gt;

This is what I know so far: *""SS Magnhild was on a voyage from Halifax to Argentia, N.

In the course of the night the 1st mate and some others went back on board several times to investigate. Eventually, the port rail was deep in the water and all the port cabins full of water. The engine room, however, appeared to be dry, while the fire room was flooded.They remained tied to the ship until dayligh t, at which time it was decided to send the motorboat to shore in order to obtain assistance.

The motorboat then returned to the ship; by that time the fog had lifted. Later that morning (May 6) a naval vessel was spotted, and being cold and exhausted they untied themselves from the ship and went to meet it.

The Dunkirk evacuation is often regarded as a ""miracle"" and it was lucky to be as successful as it was. So, my question is, was there a plan if Dynamo failed? Losing 300,000 men would have been a disaster at the time.

Was there a plan to mass-mobilise civilians and train them up? Bring troops in from abroad? Dad's Army? Maybe some sort of Volkssturm type operation, like we saw in Germany towards the end of WW2?

He then continued his work in the Contras (which yes we all know are a very questionable time). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was wondering if you all would be interested in me posting the slides he has taken throughout his career and we have digitized over the past 10 years. Most are organized by event or location. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers, guys &lt;/p&gt;

today it's the anniversary of Operation Valkyrie. I wonder why it has such an enormous meaning in Germany compared to other attempts. Valkyrie was 1944. It seems that the conspirators have been more interested in preventing the total destruction of Germany rather than in preventing the Holocaust. Furthermore among them there have been antisemitists and royalists.

So why do german people celebrate one of the last attempts rather than earlier ones which could have saved far more lives?

Alas the information about the other attempts, especially before the beginning of WW II, aren't very extensive. What I am interested in is the motivation of those other attempts, especially of those which have a left-wing background. Do you have any insightful sources?

Thank you so much in advance!

One day, to clear out space, the company decided to throw out a buildings worth of old blueprints from ELCO.  My dad served in the Navy and thought it would be cool to have a blueprint and his boss told him that he was welcome to take one.  By sheer chance, after two minutes he had the outboard profile of PT-109.  For thirty years it sat, rolled up in a metal tube in my dad's closet, and occasionally we would unroll it.  I didn't recognize the importance of the boat until I was in my twenties, at which point I suggested to my parents that we frame it and display it.  It is now in my possession and hangs on my wall out of direct sunlight.  

Last year I went to the National WW2 museum in New Orleans, and ever since then I have been wondering if this ""belongs in a museum"", as Indy would say.  I've done some internet searches and cannot find any other references to the blueprints for PT-109 existing in an archive, which has made me wonder if this is the only existing copy of anything from the PT-109 blueprint set.  I've thought about loaning/donating it to the WW2 museum or the JFK Library, though I would want to make sure that it was actually displayed somewhere that it could be appreciated by the public and not just stuck in some archive. 

I want to do a couple things, but don't really know how to do either of them, and this is where I was really hoping that a sub full of history buffs will be able to give me some advice on this.  

1. If I wanted to loan/donate it to a museum, who would I contact at an institution like that to set it up? 
2. I would like to have it valued.  I figured if I loan it to a museum I would need to have a value.  The only thing I could think of was going to Antique Roadshow, but I figure there has to be other, better methods.
3. And for my moral quandary, if you had it, would you keep it as a family heirloom or make it accessible to the public?

I didn&amp;#39;t recognize the importance of the boat until I was in my twenties, at which point I suggested to my parents that we frame it and display it.  It is now in my possession and hangs on my wall out of direct sunlight.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year I went to the National WW2 museum in New Orleans, and ever since then I have been wondering if this &amp;quot;belongs in a museum&amp;quot;, as Indy would say.  I&amp;#39;ve done some internet searches and cannot find any other references to the blueprints for PT-109 existing in an archive, which has made me wonder if this is the only existing copy of anything from the PT-109 blueprint set.  I&amp;#39;ve thought about loaning/donating it to the WW2 museum or the JFK Library, though I would want to make sure that it was actually displayed somewhere that it could be appreciated by the public and not just stuck in some archive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to do a couple things, but don&amp;#39;t really know how to do either of them, and this is where I was really hoping that a sub full of history buffs will be able to give me some advice on this.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I wanted to loan/donate it to a museum, who would I contact at an institution like that to set it up? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I would like to have it valued.  I figured if I loan it to a museum I would need to have a value.  The only thing I could think of was going to Antique Roadshow, but I figure there has to be other, better methods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And for my moral quandary, if you had it, would you keep it as a family heirloom or make it accessible to the public? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

I've become very interested in Europe history, particularly during King Henry VIII reign. I've been watching documentaries on it but am confused about how common it was to be executed  while he was is power in his court and also as a civilian. It seems like a very stressful time to be alive and like you'd always need to watch your step!

The Tudors and other Hollywood shows obviously center around his wives but the documentaries I watch make it seem as though anyone who was in his court, his wives maids, or commoners who disagreed with his views, had a very highly chance of getting executed.

The population obviously was significantly less than it is now, but it seems as though anyone in his court or people that lived near the palace were in danger.
