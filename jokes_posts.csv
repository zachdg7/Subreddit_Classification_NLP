First they visit heaven. It looks pretty nice. Big fluffy clouds, angels singing and playing harps, everyone seeming to enjoy themselves. The politician is pleased, if a bit underwhelmed.

Hell, on the other hand, is magnificent. It’s the most beautiful place the politician has ever seen, and everyone there is having the time of their lives.

Sam was particularly gifted, and on his 19th birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon a beautifully intricate note of pure magic. Everyone within miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone. And all the realm realized, instantly, that it was Sam, and Sam was the first person in history to hit one of the rumored Magical Notes that musicians had theorized must exist... yet no one before Sam had ever reached one.

And on Sam's 20th birthday, it happened again. This time, the town below was so impacted that no one moved, spoke, or even blinked for several minutes after. As the golden sound finally tapered off and ceased, they knew that Sam had found the Second Note...

And the next year on Sam's birthday, the town had realized there was a pattern involved. This time, all of the townspeople were present in the monastery's nave, watching in awe, as Sam hit the glorious Third Note. People cried out in pure joy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo. Words cannot do justice to the experience. The town flourished, as Sam's notes made the people pure all the way to the core of their beings.

And on it went for the next few years, the Magical Notes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, that is, Sam's 25th birthday. All at first seemed as normal... until Sam hit the Magical Note. From the start, Sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and discordant. Sam started to get very warm, and was visibly sweating onstage. He doubled his resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part of the Magical Note that he knew must be there.

Suddenly, to the horror of all, Sam spontaneously combusted! The two closest monks on stage were burned by the flames coming off of his body, and he ignited the stage curtains. Soon the entire monastery was aflame. By a miracle, everyone made it out, except for poor Sam.

The townsfolk were left staring at the burning monastery in sad, stunned disbelief.

A blonde gingerly works her way through the crowd and steps up to the stage.

The leader asks her, ""What is 15 plus 15?""

After 15 or 20 seconds she says, ""Eighteen!""

Obviously everyone is a little disappointed. Then 60,000 blondes start cheering, ""Give her another chance! Give her another chance!""

The leader says, ""Well since we've gone to the trouble of getting 60,000 of you in one place and we have the world- wide press and global broadcast media here, gee, uh, I guess we can give her another chance.""

So he asks, ""What is 5 plus 5?""

After nearly 30 seconds she eventually says, ""Ninety?""

The leader is quite perplexed, looks down and just lets out a dejected sigh -- everyone is disheartened - the blonde starts crying and the 60,000 girls begin to yell and wave their hands shouting, ""GIVE HER ANOTHER CHANCE! GIVE HER ANOTHER CHANCE!""

The leader, unsure whether or not he is doing more harm than good, eventually says, ""Ok! Ok! Just one more chance -- What is 2 plus 2?""

The girl closes her eyes, and after a whole minute eventually says, ""Four?""

Jamal had 3 tiers of camels for $200, $500 and $1000.

At that point Jamal took the camel to a water trough.  While the camel was drinking Jamal took 2 bricks and smashed the camel's testicles between them.

The village lived mostly self-sufficiently with farmers specializing in crops and trading with other farmers for goods and services. Jack, a humble sugar cane farmer, lived in this village when something horrible happened one night.

One morning, Old Man Richards woke to find half his cows slaughtered and eaten. Amid the corpses and bones were large, monstrous foot prints leading from Old Man Richards cows and into the forest. Word quickly spread of the butchering as Old Man Richards lived in the middle of the village and everyone who went about to trade that day had to pass by. 

That night, a horrible sound came from the chicken coups on Farmer Hopkins land. The same large foot prints from the previous night could be seen coming from the forest, passed Old Man Richards cows and into Farmer Hopkins coups. The village could not deny that something was terrorizing them and by mid day, every man woman and child had gathered in the center of the village near where the cows and chickens had been taken.

The villagers came to call the creature the ""Midicrin"" after it's propensity to strike lands in the middle of the village. They deduced that the Midicrin would strike one of three places next, Miss Angie's prize loons, for which the village had become renowned for during the few times it traded with other townships, a blackberry patch owned by Ernest Eford who was somehow older than Old Man Richards, or Jack's sugar cane farm.  

Jack sat awake all night keeping an eye on the distant forest tree line and his sugar cane fields. After what seemed like an entire day's worth of time, a strange soft pounding sound startled Jack. A terrible creature as tall as the tallest building in the village with legs as long as Jack's entire body came lumbering toward him. Paralyzed with fear, Jack watched as the Midicrin stalked forward with a ghostly silence and grabbed a mouthful of sugar cane. As the beast continued his eating, Jack watched the monster suddenly lurch and hurl up his nightly meal. The beast fell for a moment before slowly getting back up and stalking back toward the forest. 

Jack called the meeting later that day to tell of his encounter that night. Everyone became loud with cheers when Jack told of how the beast fell ill after consuming the cane. Then, Jack told the town of his idea. Surly after not eating it's usual meal the previous night, the Midicrin would be hungrier than usual. Jack postured that if they fed Miss Angie's loons with the sugar cane, the beast would inadvertently fall sick again and the entire village, hidden in waiting, could come out at once and strike the beast. 

Jack gathered as much sugar cane as he could afford to lose and brought them next door to Miss Angie's birds. After setting the trap, the village waited for night to fall and the creature to return. Sure enough, the Midicrin came back, past Old Man Richards' cows, past Farmer Hopkin's chickens, and of course past Jack's poisonous sugar cane. The Midcrin came to Miss Angies birds and began to feed ravenously. It was only after a short time that it stopped, hurled out what it had eaten, and fell backward. The entire village, charging with pitchforks and lit torched, began to berate the Midicrin until it had spilled enough blood to surely be dead. 

The moral of the story, as Jack explained, was that a loon full of sugar helps the Midicrin go down.

""Well, kind of.  See, we get a lot of fish around here, and in order to catch as many as possible, we've streamlined the process and now everyone involved is heavily specialized.  There are people who spend their whole day throwing lines out.  They just move from line to line, throwing it out and moving on.  Then there are other people who keep their eyes on a bunch of lines, and when a fish tugs on one, they run over and jerk the line to hook the fish. All day, just hooking fish after fish.  Then they move on, and someone else comes up and reels the fish in.  Then someone else collects the fish, and someone else carries them to the warehouse to be gutted.  Etc, etc, etc.""

The jobs that pay the best, the ones that everybody wants, are baiting and gutting the fish.  Gutting isn't pleasant, but the pay is good and you can work indoors.""

She thinks about that for a minute, then nods.  ""Okay, so what do you do?""

""Me?  I'm a baiter.  Have been for years!""  Uncle Tim is clearly proud of himself.  ""Not only that, but I'm at the top of the game.  See how there are people fishing all up and down here?  Well, what you probably don't realize is that you have to earn your position.  Newbies and people who aren't good at their job start out here on the street.  If you're good enough, though, you can earn a spot working on the pier, where they get twice as many fish.  And if you're a master of your specialty, you can get a place out there at the very end.  That's where they catch the most and the best fish, and that's where I work!""

The girl doesn't find this very interesting, but she goes out with her uncle and watches and helps for a few hours at the end of the pier.  She hates it.  The bate is disgusting, the hooks keep on pricking her.  It's miserable.  About halfway through the day, though a spot opens up out on the street, and she jumps at the chance to get away from her Uncle's prized job.

That night, at dinner, her mother asks, ""So, how was your day with your uncle?  Where did you go?  What did you learn?""

She thinks for a minute before replying:  ""We went to the shore today, and I learned one thing for certain.  I'd rather be a lowly street hooker than spend the rest of my life as a master baiter like Uncle Tim.""","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brother-in-law, Tim, grudgingly agrees.  He picks the girl up and takes her down to the shoreline where he works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Do you know what I do for a living?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She nods.  &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re a fisherman, right?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well, kind of.  See, we get a lot of fish around here, and in order to catch as many as possible, we&amp;#39;ve streamlined the process and now everyone involved is heavily specialized.  There are people who spend their whole day throwing lines out.  They just move from line to line, throwing it out and moving on.  Then there are other people who keep their eyes on a bunch of lines, and when a fish tugs on one, they run over and jerk the line to hook the fish. All day, just hooking fish after fish.  Then they move on, and someone else comes up and reels the fish in.  Then someone else collects the fish, and someone else carries them to the warehouse to be gutted.  Etc, etc, etc.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That seems like it would be tedious.  How do you decide which job you want?  Do you just end up doing whatever you started with until you quit?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well, no.  Everyone starts by hooking the fish.  Not many people really like that job, so everyone has to start there.  After you&amp;#39;ve been at it for a while, if a position opens up somewhere else, you can spend a few days trying out casting or reeling.

&lt;p&gt;She thinks about that for a minute, then nods.  &amp;quot;Okay, so what do you do?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Me?  I&amp;#39;m a baiter.  Have been for years!&amp;quot;  Uncle Tim is clearly proud of himself.  &amp;quot;Not only that, but I&amp;#39;m at the top of the game.

He knocked on the door and was greeted by an ancient Chinese man with a long, grey beard. ""I'm lost,"" said the man. ""Can you put me up for the night?"" 

""Certainly,"" the Chinese man said, ""but on one condition. If you so much as lay a finger on my daughter, I will inflict upon you the three worst Chinese tortures known to man."" 

""Ok,"" said the man, thinking that the daughter must be pretty old as well, and entered the house. 

Before dinner, the daughter came down the stairs. She was young, beautiful, and had a fantastic figure. She was obviously attracted to the young man since she couldn't keep her eyes off him during the meal. Remembering the old man's warning, he ignored her and went up to bed alone. But during he night, he could bear it no longer, and sneaked into her room for a night of passion. He was careful to keep everything quiet so the old man wouldn't hear. Near dawn he crept back to his room, exhausted, but happy. 

He woke to feel a pressure on his chest. Opening his eyes he saw a large rock on his chest with a note on it that read, ""Chinese Torture 1: Large rock on chest."" 

""Well, that's pretty crappy,"" he thought. ""If that's the best the old man can do then I don't have much to worry about."" He picked the boulder up, walked over to the window and threw the boulder out. As he did so he noticed another note on it that read: ""Chinese Torture 2: Rock tied to left testicle."" 

In a panic he glanced down and saw the rope that was already getting close to the end. Figuring that a few broken bones was better than castration, he jumped out of the window after the boulder. 

As he plummeted downward he saw a large sign on the ground that read, ""Chinese Torture 3: Right testicle tied to bedpost."" ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;A young man was lost wandering in a forest, when he came upon a small house. He knocked on the door and was greeted by an ancient Chinese man with a long, grey beard. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m lost,&amp;quot; said the man. &amp;quot;Can you put me up for the night?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Certainly,&amp;quot; the Chinese man said, &amp;quot;but on one condition. If you so much as lay a finger on my daughter, I will inflict upon you the three worst Chinese tortures known to man.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ok,&amp;quot; said the man, thinking that the daughter must be pretty old as well, and entered the house. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before dinner, the daughter came down the stairs. She was young, beautiful, and had a fantastic figure. She was obviously attracted to the young man since she couldn&amp;#39;t keep her eyes off him during the meal. Remembering the old man&amp;#39;s warning, he ignored her and went up to bed alone. But during he night, he could bear it no longer, and sneaked into her room for a night of passion. He was careful to keep everything quiet so the old man wouldn&amp;#39;t hear. Near dawn he crept back to his room, exhausted, but happy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He woke to feel a pressure on his chest. Opening his eyes he saw a large rock on his chest with a note on it that read, &amp;quot;Chinese Torture 1: Large rock on chest.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well, that&amp;#39;s pretty crappy,&amp;quot; he thought. &amp;quot;If that&amp;#39;s the best the old man can do then I don&amp;#39;t have much to worry about.&amp;quot; He picked the boulder up, walked over to the window and threw the boulder out. As he did so he noticed another note on it that read: &amp;quot;Chinese Torture 2: Rock tied to left testicle.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a panic he glanced down and saw the rope that was already getting close to the end. Figuring that a few broken bones was better than castration, he jumped out of the window after the boulder. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As he plummeted downward he saw a large sign on the ground that read, &amp;quot;Chinese Torture 3: Right testicle tied to bedpost.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

It was the best tea he had ever had, it was obvious by his expression too, the saint said that he used fresh tea leaves and natural sugar to make it. After they were done, the saint asked the man about his problems, and he replied with, &amp;quot;My dick is unnaturally big, almost 25 inches and it gives a lot of problems, I&amp;#39;ve tried everything doctors recommended, but had no results. Please help me!&amp;quot; The saint said, &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;ll take you 3 days of travel from here, where you&amp;#39;ll find a pond that glows in bright golden colours, there you&amp;#39;ll find a talking frog, just tell her that you want to marry her. When you so she will reply with a No, and when she does, your dick will come down by 5 inches.&amp;quot; The man wasn&amp;#39;t ready to believe it, but he thought of giving it a shot because he had come too far. The saint gave him a map to reach the place, and some tea leaves as a gift. When he reached the pond, he did really find a talking frog. She said, &amp;quot;What do you want?&amp;quot; the man replied with, &amp;quot;Will you marry me?&amp;quot; and he got denied, and magically, his dick shrunk. He asked her again and got denied. 15 Inches still felt big, so he asked her again, &amp;quot;will you marry me?&amp;quot; The frog got angry and replied, &amp;quot;How many times do I have to tell you? NO! NO! NO!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

Once upon a time, on the tropical island of Adiaster, a primitive tribe lived in a village of grass huts. There were no rival tribes on the island, no natural disasters to speak of, and no huge monsters that might emerge from the jungle in a primal rage to destroy the village. In general, life was good.

And life was about to get better! For on this particular day, a new king was ascending to the throne. Before his succession to the throne, the king had been a notorious party animal; he threw parties almost every day, and villagers flocked to his hut to participate. Ever the life of the party, the king had always been gracious host, and when his succession became imminent, villagers rejoiced at the prospect of such an amiable king.

But no kingdom is perfect, and this kingdom;s problem was classism (a problem many other kingdoms have had as well). Within this tribe, the hunters were at the top of the social hierarchy. They garnered glory and respect from their daring hunts, and were generally seen as the coolest kids on the block. At the opposite end of the spectrum, the builders and engineers of the tribe were considered the lowest class. They were often referred to as ""*nerds""* , an ancient Adiasterese term meaning ""those who bury their nose in books and diagrams all night long and have got no game"" (Adiasterese etymology is quite fascinating). As such, builders and engineers were often excluded from the kingdom's social events.

The king knew this. In fact, he had perpetuated this classism even before ascending to the throne. Even though he had never purposefully excluded engineers from his parties back in the day, nearly every attendant had been a hunter, creating an environment that would have made engineers feel incredibly uncomfortable if they showed up. The king resolved to bridge this gap between the classes of his tribe, and to do this, he promised to throw a lavish party on his coronation day. This was going to be a party for the ages: it was to be held in the palace, it was to last all night long, and everyone was invited.

This presented a problem, however. Although the palace was larger than any other hut in the village, it still wasn't large enough to hold everyone. The king decided to prepare for this by instructing his engineers to build a second floor to the palace, so that the entire tribe could party in his new house.

The head engineer was slightly nervous about the structural integrity of a hut with two stories, and he voiced those concerns to his future king. The king would not have it. ""This must be the party of a lifetime!"" he declared. ""This will bring our tribe closer together and usher in a new age of equality between hunters and engineers. You shall be in attendance as my guest of honor! You MUST build a second floor!"" When the head engineer remained uncertain, the king leaned into his head engineer's ear and whispered ""I heard there'd be *girls* at this party, too,"" and eventually the head engineer relented. The second floor to the palace was built.

This new palace was the talk of the town! Everyone thought it was the most impressive hut they had ever seen. But the king, though he would never admit it to anyone, was nervous about his coronation party. If the party wasn't *poppin'*(meaning ""a happy time for everyone involved"", usually associated with a public event that anyone can enter, as opposed to ""*lit""*, which usually carries the connotation of a more private event), it could fracture his kingdom for generations. To improve his chances of a *poppin'* party, the king called the head engineer into his chambers the night before the party and demanded that a disco ball be installed in the ceiling of the first floor.

The head engineer was flabbergasted. Not only was this incredibly short notice, but a heavy object putting pressure on the center of the building could result in the entire house collapsing. He argued with the king for hours, but the king remained undeterred. The next morning, mere minutes before the coronation began, the final touches on the disco ball were finished. The coronation itself went off without a hitch, the king was carried into his palace on his throne, and as the sun set, it was time to party.

The king had scheduled the party to begin as soon as night fell, and as soon as the sun had dipped below the horizon, the palace was flooded with people (which was highly unusual; In Adiasterese culture, it is customary to arrive to a party 45-60 minutes after the scheduled starting time). All the king's worries about his party faded immediately upon seeing the eager crowd; throngs of hunters, healers, fishermen, and even engineers had filed into his palace and having the time of their lives. Eventually, the head engineer arrived, and true to his word, the king loudly announced his guest of honor to a rowdy cheer. As the night wore on, the tribe seemed to grow closer. Hunters and engineers laughed together, drank together, and even played *pong* together (a traditional Adiasterese game in which small rocks are thrown at jugs of fermented fruit). Everything was going according to plan.

In the middle of the night, as the party continued, the king noticed that many of the partygoers had spilled drinks all over his throne. Ordinarily, this would have resulted in capital punishment; the throne had been passed down through generations of royalty and was sacred to the inhabitants of the village. But the king knew that now was not the time for punishment. It was a party! Getting all serious and traditional now could ruin the unity that he had worked so hard to foster. In order to save his throne from more desecration, he ordered several hunters to carry it upstairs, where no drinks were being served.

The head engineer, upon seeing this, yelled at the king to stop. He knew that if an object as heavy as the royal throne was brought onto the second floor of the house, the whole building would collapse. Unfortunately, the king was enjoying the party too much to be concerned with the head engineer's worries. ""Oh come on!"" he roared, ""enjoy the party! You've done enough worrying for a lifetime. Have some fun!""

But the king should have heeded his engineer's warning. For at that moment, as the throne was placed on the second floor, the hut collapsed. The party dissolved as the surviving tribespeople fled the scene. When the king came to, nearly half of his tribe had died, including his head engineer.

\~

Ten years later, the king still ruled his tribe. He still threw parties every day, in his rebuilt palace, and as always everyone was invited. But he still remembered that day that he lost half his tribe and one of his closest friends. To anyone who would listen, he would repeat the valuable lessons he learned that day:

&gt;!People in grass houses should NOT stow thrones,!&lt;

So, he's watching a heavy metal music video, and the guitarist plays an amazing solo. The horse says ""that looks amazing, I want to do that!""

The horse goes to the phone book, looks up a music teacher and calls him. ""Hi, I'd like to learn to play guitar."" Says the horse.

""Sure,"" says the man on the phone. ""Just come to your lesson and we'll get you started.""

""There's just one problem,"" says the horse. ""I'm a horse.""

""Not to worry,"" the man says. ""We have new state of the art technology to teach horses. You'll be playing like a pro in no time.""

Sure enough, the horse gets really good at the guitar and he can play that amazing solo. He wants to show his friends, so he picks up the phone and calls chicken.

""Hey Chicken, come over!"" he says. Chicken comes over, watches horse play the guitar and thinks it's pretty cool. Chicken watches the music video and says ""hey, that drum part is pretty cool, I want to learn to play that.""

Chicken goes to the phone book, looks up a music teacher and calls him. ""Hi, I'd like to learn to play the drums."" Says the chicken.

""Sure,"" says the man on the phone. ""Just come to your lesson and we'll get you started.""

""There's just one problem,"" says the chicken. ""I'm a chicken.""

""Not to worry,"" the man says. ""We have new state of the art technology to teach chickens. You'll be playing like a pro in no time.""

Sure enough, the chicken gets really good and begins to jam with the horse. Eventually, they think that something's missing. They watch the video again and realize they need a bass guitarist. They call their friend Cow and show them what they've been up to. Cow thinks it's pretty cool, and wants to learn how to play the bass guitar.

Cow goes to the phone book, looks up a music teacher and calls him. ""Hi, I'd like to learn to play bass guitar."" Says the cow.

""Sure,"" says the man on the phone. ""Just come to your lesson and we'll get you started.""

""There's just one problem,"" says the cow. ""I'm a cow.""

""Not to worry,"" the man says. ""We have new state of the art technology to teach cows. You'll be playing like a pro in no time.""

Sure enough, the cow gets really good at the bass and the animals have a nice band going.

One day, while they're practicing, a man walks by and hears them. He goes up to the animals and says ""hey, you guys are pretty good! I'm from a record label, I'd like to sign you!""

The band records an album, puts out some singles and becomes a massive success. They go on a worldwide tour and make tons of money. Right before the last show of the tour, which is supposed to be in Vegas, Horse gets a call. His mother is in hospital.

Horse goes to visit her before the show while the rest of the band goes to Vegas to set up. It turns out that she's all good, it's just a cold. As horse is leaving the hospital, he gets another call. The private jet that was carrying the band and their producer crashed into the ocean, and there were no survivors.

Horse is devastated. All of his best friends are dead, he's out of a job and he's stuck with nowhere to go. He breaks down in tears and decides he'll drink himself to death.

So the horse walks into a bar.

The bartender asks, ""why the long face?""","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was back when MTV played music videos.
